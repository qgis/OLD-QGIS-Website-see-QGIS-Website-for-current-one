"I work for a urban planning company in China.  It is often difficult to "
"design proper environmental protection because the common sources of data "
"may be a state secret or may not even exist.  Frequently, we are asked to do"
" designs without proper survey data.   In addition there is usually not "
"enough time for a proper study.  My background is in Urban Planning with a "
"minor in Environmental Science."

"The task was plan a conservation park on the Chinese side of the Ili River "
"which supplies 80% of the water to Lake Balkhash.  FOSS GIS application + "
"FOSS GIS data stores + FOSS GIS education were all critical to reconstruct "
"and model the Hydrological and Ecological processes necessary for authentic "
"conservation planning.  As a non-scientist with no prior training or "
"experience I could not have done it without all three.  My company did not "
"and would not pay to purchase GIS software to run the industry standard "
"arcHYDRO."

"With some trial and error I was able to produce an arcHYDRO like output from"
" QGIS.  Beginning with a USGS Hydrosheds DEM which was converted into a "
"Regularized Spline with Tension using the GRASS functions inside QGIS and "
"training by Helena Mitsova.  The RST surface was analyzed this surface to "
"find the catchments and flow paths, and resulting vector topologies were "
"cleaned up in QGIS to generate the Hydrologic network and also to build up "
"the attribute tables."

"This network was ranked by r.stream extension in GRASS to build Hortons and "
"Hacks stream ordering.  Then a distance to outlet surface grid was generated"
" and analyzed by zonal statistics to find the farthest point.  Next, r.drain"
" in GRASS to trace a time of concentration line.  Finally v.net in GRASS was"
" used to build a network of pour points, flow paths, TOC paths, and HMDP for"
" each watershed.  In this workflow, the QGIS tool attribute by location was "
"invaluable."

"After the basic hydrologic network was finished I used UN FAO soils database"
" with table joins to classify soils.  Then using query functions in QGIS the"
" FAO soils were converted to USDA soils.  A previously downloaded USGS ETM7+"
" grid was classified with the i.cluser and r.maxlik in GRASS into a NLCD "
"grid.  By using reclassification tables I converted the landcover to "
"Manning's n-value grid for overland flow.  Finally I wrote a lookup table in"
" r.mapcalc and merged the soil and landcover grids into and NRCS TR-55 curve"
" numbers following the arcHYDRO methodology."

"To create the rainfall grids I performed statistical analysis on GHCN tables"
" to find rainfall depths for design storms of 1,2,5,10,50,100 year returns. "
"Then I downloaded a free sample grid of PRISM for China and assuming a "
"linear relationship, converted average cell values to maximum cell values in"
" order to build maximum rainfall intensity grids."

"I began using QGIS out of desperation for lack of arcMAP but now I never "
"want to go back.  The investment of time in FOSS is worthwhile because you "
"can take it with you to any job.  The combination of GRASS QGIS PostGIS "
"gives you the full functionality of expensive GIS systems.   The online "
"learning resources provided were as valuable as the actual software.  I was "
"able to learn QGIS fast enough to produce a great project in a fast based "
"real world industry environment."
