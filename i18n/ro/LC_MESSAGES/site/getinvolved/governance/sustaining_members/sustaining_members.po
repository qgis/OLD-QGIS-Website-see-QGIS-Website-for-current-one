"QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out "
"largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, "
"valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. As a "
"result, you have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide"
" on our web site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks,"
" less interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left "
"behind. In addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses"
" and conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very "
"expensive for volunteer developers."
msgstr ""
"QGIS este un proiect cu sursă deschisă, în întregime. Dezvoltarea QGIS se "
"realizează, în mare parte, de către un grup de voluntari, care în timp au "
"construit o bază de cod, mare, valoroasă și utilă, de folosință liberă "
"pentru oricine. Aveți acces liber la codul sursă și la binarele pe care le "
"oferă pe site-ul nostru. Ca rezultat al acestei abordări, un număr de "
"sarcini, mai puțin interesantr sau importantr pentru dezvoltatori, sunt, "
"uneori, lăsate în urmă. În plus, promovarea QGIS necesită participarea "
"noastră la congrese și conferințe, precum și producerea de materiale de "
"informare, uneori foarte scumpe pentru dezvoltatorii voluntari."
