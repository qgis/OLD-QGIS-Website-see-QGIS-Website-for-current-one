"Using QGIS for urban planning in the municipality of Montecchio Maggiore, "
"Vicenza, Italy Montecchio Maggiore is a small town in the middle west of "
"Vicenza (about 24.000 population). And as many other italian municipality it"
" manages the town planning; in particular the urban planning and what we "
"call “recovery plan” aka PDR - Piani Di Recupero. This urbanistic tool is "
"dedicated to the historical area in the center of the town and it requires a"
" specific study: building state of conservation, intended use, particular "
"historical notice via survey and restitution to produce planimetric and "
"prospectus graphics. For this purpose it has used QGIS in addition to "
"Postgresql/Postgis database, PHP code and Libreoffice suite, QCAD "
"(LibreCAD)."

"Every building data was retrieved via survey and written in paper schedule. "
"Once in office the data were inputed into the Postgresql/Postgis database "
"via PHP form using canonical web browser (Firefox, Iceweasel as well). In a "
"second moment the shape of every building was draw with QGIS and linked to "
"the survey table via id key field (PostgreSQL/Postgis view)."

"For every graphic thematic maps were produced using the attribute and data "
"retrieve during the survey (for the present state) and data modified during "
"the study and design fase. Thus a photo was linked to every building "
"facilitating the design and analisys in the gis project (using the “action” "
"feature). The SQL tools (pgquery, postgis manager, dbmanager et al.) allowed"
" to obtain very sophisticated query immediately viewable in the map canvas "
"such as: volume calculation split by building intended use, standards area "
"calculation in percentage of the total planning area and other minor "
"queries. All useful items for the design and planning study otherwise not "
"possible without a very strength tool like gis (and QGIS in particular)."

"The strength of QGIS is the very user friendly interface coupled with the "
"several tools it offers. The connection with vary data formats (shape files,"
" spatialite db, postgresql/postgis db,...) facilitates and increases the "
"interoperability between different worlds. And thus the freedom offered by "
"the free software (QGIS, PHP, Libreoffice, QCAD) stimulates and open new "
"horizons. And last but not least: we worked on different platform (Windows 7"
" 64 bit, Windows xp 32 bit, Debian server and Debian client) but we never "
"encountered insurmountable problems."
