"The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia "
"(JPBD) is a federal agency that advises matters on town and country "
"planning. The scope of administration for the department however is limited "
"to Peninsular Malaysia as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia have their "
"respective town planning agencies. Town and country planning is on the "
"concurrent list in the Federal Legislation, thus, at the federal level, JPBD"
" advises the Housing and Local Government Minister from which JPBD gets its "
"patronage as well as to advise the National Physical Planning Council "
"chaired by the Prime Minister. At the state level, the state director "
"advises the State Planning Committee chaired by the Chief Minister. At the "
"local level, JPBD advises local planning authorities on planning matters by "
"being involved in the preparation of mandatory development plans. At "
"Headquarters, the National Physical Plan Division prepares the National "
"Physical Plan while four regional project offices assist in the preparation "
"of State Structure Plans, District Local Plans and Special Area Plans. As "
"public agencies were traditionally established base on their specialization,"
" JPBD is the custodian of landuse information."

"QGIS (QGIS) was first introduced to the Malaysian Open Source community as a"
" viable alternative to proprietary GIS for public agencies by JPBD at the "
"Malaysian Government Open Source Conference (MyGOSSCON) in 2009 and to the "
"Malaysian GIS community at the 4th National GIS Conference and Exhibition "
"(NGIS) in 2010. JPBD has traditionally been a user of proprietary GIS thus "
"the introduction of QGIS was a real eye opener not only from the point-of-"
"view of Open Source Software (OSS), what more, OSS GIS. Open source "
"philosophy was different thus QGIS felt alien, unsure and unsafe, not "
"surprisingly the idea to use QGIS did not receive much support internally, "
"in fact, it faced resistance in 2010 from the top managment all the way down"
" to the support group."

"On the opposite side, request for technical talks on QGIS came from other "
"technical agencies which JPBD gave to the Ministry of Works and the "
"Department of Irrigation and Drainage. Other works to promote QGIS from JPBD"
" came in the form of newsletter articles on QGIS to the Open Source "
"Competency Centre (OSCC) at the Prime Minister's Department and articles "
"introducing QGIS to the Survey Department's GIS Bulletin and the Ministry of"
" Natural Resource's Public Sector GeoSpatial Bulletin. In the meantime, JPBD"
" researched on developing a slope analysis module for QGIS's Windows and "
"Ubuntu version. The study highlighted pros and cons of customizing a module "
"and the high level of commitment from the management needed to ensure its "
"continual success and adoption. In 2011, JPBD began to further research on "
"QGIS more as an analytical tool rather than a mapping tool in order to "
"pioneer untapped modules or new approaches at exploiting QGIS."

"The department eventually promoted the QGIS-GRASS package instead of merely "
"QGIS as it was found to be most powerful and helpful for town planning "
"purposes such as cleaning topology error and overcoming limitations of the "
"default standard inputs. That was merely the beginning."

"In order to centralize and share findings in the use of QGIS for town "
"planning purpose which could also be use in other fields dealing with "
"spatial analysis, an unofficial blog established by the author called “QGIS "
"MALAYSIA” at http://www.qgismalaysia.blogspot.com was made to generate a "
"QGIS community in Malaysia. External agencies seem to have more interest in "
"QGIS than JPBD itself and upon their request, JPBD gave QGIS training to the"
" Fire and Safety Department as well as to the Ministry of Education whom "
"later was convinced QGIS will be their de facto GIS tool. Hearing this, "
"JPBD's Research and Development Division took the initiative and requested "
"for QGIS training and subsequently 12 persons were trained. Word of mouth (a"
" godsend thing, though at times, extremely detrimental) spread that QGIS was"
" indeed user-friendly, easy to use and at par with proprietary GIS in "
"mapping task and could take on proprietary GIS when optimized with GRASS "
"modules."

"Interest in QGIS stirred and in 2012, with the support of all project office"
" directors, an all-out effort was undertaken by the National Landuse "
"Information Division that spearheaded QGIS to train the 4 project offices as"
" they hold the greatest number of GIS users. By the end of 2012, it is "
"anticipated that at least 320 staff throughout JPBD will use QGIS which "
"accounts for approximately 90 % of GIS users in the department. That is not "
"all. States town planning departments have also requested QGIS training such"
" as Perak including strong interest from poorer states like Perlis and "
"Kelantan. If this catches on, it is anticipated that the use of QGIS may "
"dominate states planning departments and even extend to local planning "
"authorities, many of which are not wealthy. In the meantime, JPBD is "
"seriously studying the use of the QGIS-PosgreSQL-PostGIS package for every "
"planning office's client GIS-geodatabase server structure to serve as the "
"foundation of JPBD's integrated landuse (iPLAN) network."
