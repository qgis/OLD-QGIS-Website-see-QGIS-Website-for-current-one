"Portugal has been affected by large wildfires causing huge losses, not only "
"environmental, but also economic and social losses. To face this risk, the "
"portuguese government, through the National Forest Authority (AFN), decided,"
" a few years ago, to create technical offices allocated to local governments"
" which, among other skills, must prepare Municipal Plans for Forest Fire "
"Protection and Operational Response."

"In order to support the elaboration of these documents, the AFN provided "
"technical guides with a methodology for calculating and mapping the Forest "
"Fire Hazard and Risk. Moreover, tutorials have been offered to follow this "
"methodology, using Proprietary Software. However, the acquisition and "
"licensing costs of that software are unaffordable for most of the smaller "
"local administrations and so, it was decided to create and make available a "
"guide with a methodology for developing Hazard and Risk cartography using "
"only Free and Open Source Software [http://goo.gl/TSv2E]."

"It was proposed to use the following set of software: QGIS, GRASS GIS, gvSIG"
" and GDAL/OGR libraries. That guide describes all the geoprocessing tasks "
"necessary for the elaboration of the plans for Forest Fire Protection and "
"Operational Response, according to the AFN methodology. A large part of the "
"tasks were developed with QGIS, and spatial analysis in raster model was "
"developed with GRASS. gvSIG was used for network analysis, with its Network "
"Analysis extension, and GDAL/OGR libraries were used for transformations "
"between coordinate reference systems."

"After an extensive suite of tests to the methodology, and three years of "
"real application in the preparation of the Operational Plan for the "
"municipality of Pinhel, it can be said that the proposed alternatives allow "
"to replace, with many advantages, Proprietary Software that is usually used "
"to carry out this task. The validation of the results shows that, despite "
"the relative simplicity of the conceptual model, its predictive ability is "
"quite good, and that the model implementation in Open Source Software does "
"not interfere negatively with the results, quite the opposite."

"In a second phase, it was tried to speed up this process, using models to "
"establish a workflow that perform a wide set of tasks, almost without human "
"intervention. This second stage consisted essentially in the automation of "
"the entire procedure described in practical guide which resulted from the "
"first phase. Such automation could mean a reduction of several hours of "
"intense work on the part of the technician who intends to produce annually "
"Forest Defense Plans, for just a few minutes, in which the human "
"intervention boils down to the selection of input data and the indication of"
" the place where we intend to keep the output data."

"In furtherance of this second phase, we used the Python version of Sextante "
"software, that works integrated into QGIS and adds a broad set of "
"independent applications (GRASS GIS, SAGA GIS, OTB, R, GDAL/OGR, Pymorph, "
"LASTools, Python scrips, etc..) in a single interface, providing a huge "
"geoprocessing toolbox to QGIS users. Besides the integration of these "
"applications in QGIS, Sextante has a tool for creating models, taking "
"advantage of the modules offered by any of those softwares which aggregates."
" So, we've created a model to automate the process of producing Forest Fire "
"Hazard and Risk maps, using GRASS, SAGA, fTools and MMQGIS tools."

"The results obtained so far are very promising, as already can be "
"automatically achieved the creation of the Hazard and Risk Maps [2]. Taking "
"into account that the Python version of Sextante is still very recent and is"
" in heavy construction, there are some problems that must be corrected so "
"that the models may be completed, which certainly will happen very soon, "
"given the momentum that Sextante project presents. As future work, we intend"
" to apply, also automatically, the symbology to the results as well as "
"provide the final layouts in QGIS Composer, ready for export and/or print. "
"Upon completion of the second phase and the realization of a sufficient set "
"of tests that can validate the results obtained, it is our intention to "
"provide the model free and openly."

"The alternatives studied proved to be of enormous quality, allowing all "
"operations recommended in the National Forest Authority technical guides, in"
" many ways, more efficiently than with Proprietary Software. In terms of "
"ease of use, it was observed that this type of software is not, in any way, "
"more complex than the proprietary software, requiring only more technical "
"knowledge of the models and algorithms implemented which, however, allow a "
"higher degree of freedom, making possible to explore and fine tune the "
"models to each particular situation. The process of producing Forest Fire "
"Hazard and Risk cartography using, exclusively, Open Source Software is "
"fully consolidated, after several years of testing and application in the "
"municipality of Pinhel."

"The fact that Open Source Software is based on standards and support most of"
" the open data formats, allows the complete interoperability between "
"software, allowing the user to opt for the most suitable in each moment. "
"Despite our proposal point to a specific set of software, nothing prevents "
"to be replaced by any of the existing alternatives in the wide range of "
"proposals for Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial. However, QGIS "
"increasingly presents itself as the most complete, stable and easy to use "
"FOSS4G solution, and whose project is more dynamic, with rapid correction of"
" bugs and with almost daily implementation of new plugins that adds specific"
" functionalities to the most diverse areas of activities."
