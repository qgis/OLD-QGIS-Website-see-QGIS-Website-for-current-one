"The Southern Downs Regional Council (SDRC) is a small-to-medium sized local "
"government in south east Queensland, Australia. The council region, mainly "
"the southern part, suffers from major bushfires. Bushfire is a real and "
"present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs "
"Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property. This project will"
" allow the council and the people of the region to be more aware of the risk"
" and to allow for better decision making in the future."

"As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of "
"Queensland, the state government requires that each local government "
"identifies the bushfire hazard in their area via the State Planning Policy "
"1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide [1]. "
"This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was instead "
"done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS."

"QGIS, using the GRASS plugin, was selected as it provided the tools needed "
"to complete the job and the interaction between QGIS and GRASS made it easy "
"to process the raster maps and present them in a meaningful way to users. "
"SDRC uses MapInfo for its main GIS system, however MapInfoâ€™s addons were not"
" as powerful as GRASS GIS for raster processing. The QGIS GRASS plugin was "
"used to import 5 meter contours of the whole region into GRASS which were "
"then converted into a contour raster map using r.surf.contour. A slope and "
"aspect map were then generated using r.slope.aspect from the raster contour "
"map. Categories were assigned to different slope and aspect ranges and given"
" a hazard risk sore. Vegetation areas were also given different risk scores."
" All the resulting raster maps were then combined using mapcalc and given a "
"final risk hazard score. The risk scores are then divided into three main "
"categories: high; medium; and low."

"The final part of the process was field verification via the rural fire "
"service. After the review process, QGIS was used to print the final maps for"
" presentation. As all GRASS commands can be run from the command line, all "
"the commands that were needed to generate the bushfire hazard maps were "
"recorded, for documentation purposes and for if the maps needed to be "
"regenerated some time in the future."

"Overall QGIS, together with the GRASS plugin, provided a great experience "
"and a great final outcome for the council doing their own bushfire hazard "
"mapping. The GRASS plugin provides a very easy to use interface to GRASS "
"through QGIS. As QGIS is able to open the GRASS raster format natively, "
"integration is very seamless and maps can be made with ease. The project won"
" an encouragement award at the Queensland Planning Institute of Australia "
"state planning awards in 2010 [2]"
