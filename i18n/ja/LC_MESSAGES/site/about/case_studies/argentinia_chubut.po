"In our region, Argentinean Patagonia, we have very few references about the "
"application of GIS in High School for the construction of geographical "
"knowledge as a mean to face territorial and environmental issues. The case "
"of the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town analyzed by QuantumGIS,"
" tends to demonstrate a methodology of an academic exercise that can "
"project, with important reaches, as formative instances related to the "
"geographical reasoning in students of 12th grade of the Abraham Lincoln "
"School. We started by the observation (inventory), digitizing the cadastral "
"blocks and the green areas (tree´s canopy) using Google Earth satellite "
"images. As a conceptual framework, we lectured about cartographic design, "
"satellite images reading and interpretation, and specially, location "
"analysis to contrast the situation (in m2) of the urban green spaces by "
"inhabitant in Rada Villa coastal town, with values suggested by the World "
"Health Organization -WHO- (a  minimum of 9 m2 of green areas, by person, in "
"urban areas)."

msgid ""
"Based in the projection of an average value of 4 inhabitants by cadastral "
"plot, we estimated that the current (2010) urban population Rada Tilly would"
" go up to around 9.600 inhabitants. These people reside in 209 blocks and "
"they represent 157.6 hectares. The average population density would be of 61"
" inhabitants by hectare. The total inventoried green areas grow up to "
"150.736 m2 (15 hectares). Reason why we can consider that the green area by "
"inhabitant in the study area is 15.7 m2 (the WHO suggested value is 9m2 of "
"green area by inhabitant). This value proves a very favorable situation, as "
"far as the environmental benefits, that trees offer to the inhabitants in "
"this marine coastal town."

"Although the project was an academic exercise of High School, we deeply "
"value the inventory´s results obtained by QGIS. Students worked with all "
"academic rigor and seriousness, showing appropriation of the thematic (urban"

"After the project experience we can assure that the FOSS QuantumGIS is an "

"that we have being using."
