"QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out "
"largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, "
"valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. As a "
"result, you have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide "
"on our web site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks, "
"less interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left behind. "
"In addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses and "
"conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very "
"expensive for volunteer developers."

"QGISは完全なオープンソースプロジェクトです.QGISの開発の大部分はボランティアのグループに担われています,そのグループはどんどん成長して価値があり便利なコードをベースにすべての人が自由な利用したり改良したりできます.その結果あなたは私たちのWEBサイトから自由にソースコードやバイナリを利用することができます.このようにボランティアの手法を利用した結果多くの課題のうち開発者にとって興味や重要性が低いものは後回しにされることがあります.それに加えてQGISをプロモートするための活動として会議やカンファレンスに参加したり資料をつくったりすることはボランティアの開発者が多くの時間を割かなければなりません."
