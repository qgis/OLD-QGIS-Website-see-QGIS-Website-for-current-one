"The Research Institute for Geo-hydrological Protection of Turin (IRPI), "
"member of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), started its "
"activities in 1970. The skills gathered since its foundation concern various"
" following investigation sectors, e.g. the study of geological and "
"hydrogeological features of the Alpine-Po river system (Northern Italy) or "
"the monitoring, prediction and prevention of natural disasters. These tasks "
"are carried out by the employment of a multidisciplinary approach including "
"hearth sciences, engineering and geomatic."

Keterampilan yang dikumpulkan sejak berdirinya berbagai sektor penyelidikan berikut, misalnya studi geologi dan hidrogeologi dari sistem Alpine-Po sungai (Italia Utara) atau pemantauan, prediksi dan pencegahan bencana alam. Tugas ini dilakukan oleh tenaga kerja dari pendekatan multidisiplin termasuk ilmu perapian, teknik dan geomatika."

"In order to cope with such amount of data a GIS approach was adopted. First "
