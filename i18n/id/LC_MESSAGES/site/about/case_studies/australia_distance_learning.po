"The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a regional university located"
" in south-east Queensland, Australia. It has 28,000 students studying both "
"on and off campus. The access of off-campus students to modern technologies "
"such as Internet services varies widely. They also use different types of "
"computers (e.g. Notebook, Desktop etc.) with different operating systems "
"(e.g. Windows, MacOS, and Linux)."

"Providing education in both an On-campus and Off-campus mode has many "
"technological challenges. Teaching a GIS course requires overcoming these "
"challenges. On average, 300-350 students enrol in the basic GIS course every"
" year. About 80% of them study in the off-campus mode."

"GIS education is incomplete without hands-on processing skills. However, "
"providing hands-on GIS skills to off-campus students is not easy because of "

"The traditional GIS education program at USQ was originally designed to "
"provide different levels of access to GIS learning resources. On-campus "
"students received simultaneous hands-on GIS instruction while the Off-campus"
" students attended a residential school at USQ’s main campus later on to "
"receive hands-on GIS instruction. Providing different levels of instruction "
"to different groups of students enrolled in the same course at the same time"
" wasn’t considered fair to the students. Removing this inequity became a "
"priority."

"Different open access geospatial software programs were evaluated for our "

"adopted it and enriched it with additional learning resources developed at "

"In conclusion, using QGIS software in teaching GIS courses at educational "
"institutions with an online learning environment offers large benefits to "
"both the students and the university. However, there are two important "
"aspects to successfully using QGIS for learning and teaching. Firstly, there"
" is a need to develop customised hands-on learning resources suitable for "
"local environment and secondly, the assessment procedure should require use "
"of the software."
