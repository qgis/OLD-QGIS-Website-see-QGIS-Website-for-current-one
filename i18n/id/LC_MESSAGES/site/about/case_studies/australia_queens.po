"The Southern Downs Regional Council (SDRC) is a small-to-medium sized local "

"present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs "
"Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property."

"As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of "
"Queensland, the state government requires that each local government "
"identifies the bushfire hazard in their area via the State Planning Policy "
"1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide [1]. "
"This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was instead "
"done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS."
msgstr "Sebagai permasalahan yang tidak hanya diderita oleh Southern Dawn melainkan seluruh Queensland, pemerintahan negara bagian menginstruksikan setiap pemerintahan daerah untuk mengidentifikasi ancaman kebakaran semak diwilayah masing-masing melalui Peraturan Perencanaan Negara Bagian 1/03 Mitigasi Dampak Kerugian oleh Ancaman Banjir, Kebakaran Semak dan Tanah Longsor [1] (State Planning Policy 1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide [1]). Pekerjaan ini seharusnya dilaksanakan oleh para konsultan, akan tetapi yang melakukan adalah dari pihak dewan sendiri dengan bantuan kombinasi penggunaan QGIS dan GRASS."

"The QGIS GRASS plugin was used to import 5 meter contours of the whole "
"region into GRASS which were then converted into a contour raster map using "
"r.surf.contour. A slope and aspect map were then generated using "
"r.slope.aspect from the raster contour map. Categories were assigned to "
"different slope and aspect ranges and given a hazard risk sore. Vegetation "
"areas were also given different risk scores. All the resulting raster maps "
"were then combined using mapcalc and given a final risk hazard score. The "
"risk scores are then divided into three main categories: high; medium; and "
