"The QGIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically somewhere "
"in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face time for "
"developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, putting heads "
"together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our "
":ref:`QGIS_sustaining_memberships` to facilitate the event, with co-funding "
"from the host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for "
"hosting the meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by "
"donating their time and in many cases financially supporting their visit to "
"the meeting directly."
