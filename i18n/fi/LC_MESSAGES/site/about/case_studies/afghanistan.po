"The Danish Demining Group (DDG), the specialised mine action unit of the "
"Danish Refugee Council, has been working in Afghanistan since 1999, "
"undertaking humanitarian mineclearance, unexploded ordnance (UXO) disposal "
"and mine risk education. DDG Afghanistan delivers humanitarian mine action "
"to save life, strengthen the sense of safety through risk education and help"
" remove obstacles to the productive use of resources, helping to realise "
"Afghanistan’s development potential. Since the start of operations in "
"Afghanistan, DDG has removed over 24,000 landmines and over 940,000 pieces "
"of UXO. Currently, DDG is working in the northern provinces of Balkh and "
"Samangan, and the central provinces of Kabul, Parwan and Panjshir."

"In Afghanistan, mineclearance activities are coordinated through the Mine "
"Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA), who collect and "
"disseminate geospatial information on known hazards (minefields, "
"battlefields, ‘spot’ UXO tasks), and update this information as clearance "
"progresses. New shapefiles of these ‘hazard polygons’ are issued by the "
"MACCA on a regular basis, and mineclearance organisations can use these to "
"assess the situation of mineclearance in their areas of operation. DDG is "
"trialling the use of QGIS within the organization to replace the expensive "
"commercial softwares it has used in the past."

"The use of geospatial data is most useful in the planning and survey phases."
" In Afghanistan, security problems and rugged terrain mean that physical re-"
"survey of known sites is not always easy. Instead, the use of a mixture of "
"data --– satellite or aerial photography underlays, digitized Soviet-era "
"topographic maps, hazard shapefiles and digital elevation models –-- allow "
"DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield in relation to the terrain"
" and surrounding natural and physical features before sending in a survey "
"team. QGIS plugins add useful capabilities, like the ability to visualise "
"terrain in 3D. The attached screenshot above –-- made using the plugin "
"Qgis2threejs --- shows an area just south of the Darulaman Palace in Kabul, "
"with active minefields (along the ridgelines on the left) shown in red over "
"a Soviet topographic raster layer combined with SRTM data. Minefields "
"already cleared show as light green."

"Kabul University’s campus is still contaminated with suspected hazardous "
"areas --– thought to comprise of air-dropped bombs or similar ordnance. "
"While not posing any immediate threat to students or staff, these hazards "
"will require eventual clearance to allow future construction within an "
"educational institution vital to Afghanistan’s future development. The "
"hazards are also notable as among the last significant remaining hazardous "
"areas in the Kabul metropolitan area. By using QGIS to combine the hazard "
"polygons from earlier surveys with highly accurate aerial photography "
"provided by the USGS, discrepancies can be noted –-- e.g. where the polygons"
" do not match the shape of the buildings, as evident in the northwest part "
"of the campus --- which can direct survey teams to places to first conduct a"
" more accurate re-survey."

"QGIS also syncs well with data collected from field operations using "
"handheld Garmin GPS, allowing clearance maps to be made with the locations "
"of mines found and destroyed."

"The use of QGIS, along with a renewed interest in data analysis, has spurred"
" new ways of looking at the data available, and combining it with other data"
" sources to better target mineclearance activities. It is also driving "
"improved mapping capabilities within the organisation, and an ability to "
"better communicate the impact of its work to international donors. In a part"
" of the world where ‘formal’ GIS training is difficult to acquire, the "
"collaborative nature of the QGIS user community is greatly appreciated, as "
"technical problems can often be solved by consulting online forums. In "
"short, QGIS is playing a role in working towards ridding Afghanistan of "
"landmines and UXO."
