"The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia "
"(JPBD) is a federal agency that advises matters on town and country "
"planning. The scope of administration for the department however is limited "
"to Peninsular Malaysia as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia have their "
"respective town planning agencies. Town and country planning is on the "
"concurrent list in the Federal Legislation, thus, at the federal level, JPBD"
" advises the Housing and Local Government Minister from which JPBD gets its "
"patronage as well as to advise the National Physical Planning Council "
"chaired by the Prime Minister. At the state level, the state director "
"advises the State Planning Committee chaired by the Chief Minister. At the "
"local level, JPBD advises local planning authorities on planning matters by "
"being involved in the preparation of mandatory development plans. At "
"Headquarters, the National Physical Plan Division prepares the National "
"Physical Plan while four regional project offices assist in the preparation "
"of State Structure Plans, District Local Plans and Special Area Plans. As "
"public agencies were traditionally established base on their specialization,"
" JPBD is the custodian of landuse information."
msgstr "Il Dipartimento federale di pianificazione di città e contea, Malaysia peninsulare (JPBD) è un'agenzia federale che fornisce consulenza su questioni di pianificazione urbanistica e territoriale. L'ambito di amministrazione per il reparto è limitato alla Malesia peninsulare come Sabah e Sarawak, in Malesia orientale hanno le loro rispettive agenzie urbanistiche. La pianificazione urbana e territoriale è nel diritto federale, e per questo, JPBD è consulente del Ministero del governo sulle abitazioni e località, da cui JPBD prende il suo patrocinio, così come è consulente al Consiglio di Pianificazione Fisica Nazionale, presieduto dal Primo Ministro. A livello statale, il direttore è stato consulente del Comitato di pianificazione di Stato presieduto dal Primo Ministro. A livello locale, JPBD è consulente presso autorità urbanistiche locali in materia di pianificazione, coinvolti nella preparazione dei piani di sviluppo obbligatori. Il Piano nazionale della divisione della fisica prepara il piano mentre quattro uffici regionali assistono alla preparazione dei Piani di struttura statale, Distretto Piani locali e aree speciali. Come ente pubblico, JPBD è custode di informazioni sull'uso del suolo."

"QGIS was first introduced to the Malaysian Open Source community as a viable"
" alternative to proprietary GIS for public agencies by JPBD at the Malaysian"
" Government Open Source Conference (MyGOSSCON) in 2009 and to the Malaysian "
"GIS community at the 4th National GIS Conference and Exhibition (NGIS) in "
"2010. JPBD has traditionally been a user of proprietary GIS thus the "
"introduction of QGIS was a real eye opener not only from the point-of-view "
"of Open Source Software (OSS), what more, OSS GIS. Open source philosophy "
"was different thus QGIS felt alien, unsure and unsafe, not surprisingly the "
"idea to use QGIS did not receive much support internally, in fact, it faced "
"resistance in 2010 from the top managment all the way down to the support "
"group."
