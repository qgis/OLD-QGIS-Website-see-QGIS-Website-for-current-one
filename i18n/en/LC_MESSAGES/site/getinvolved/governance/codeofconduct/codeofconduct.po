"Like the technical community as a whole, the QGIS team and community is "

"Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to "
"communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground "
"rules that we ask people to adhere to when they’re participating within "
"this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, "
"mentors and those seeking help and guidance."

"This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take "

"Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on "

"Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for "
"poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration "
"now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a "
"personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people"
" feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the"
" QGIS community should be respectful when dealing with other members as "
"well as with people outside the QGIS community."

"Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and QGIS is"
" no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and "
"differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The "
"strength of QGIS comes from its varied community, people from a wide "
"range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on "
"issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t "
"mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming"
" each other doesn’t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving "
"issues and to help learn from mistakes."
