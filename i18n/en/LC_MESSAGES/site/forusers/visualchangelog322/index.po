"QGIS 3.22 Białowieża is aimed at celebrating the 100-year anniversary of "
"`Białowieża National Park "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa_National_Park>`__, "
"Poland, which was established in 1921. `Białowieża Forest "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa_Forest>`__ is one of "
"the world’s last primary woodlands, located on the border between Poland "
"and Belarus. It is one of the few natural old-growth forests in temperate"
" lowland Europe and has been protected for over 600 years. The "
"outstanding value of Białowieża Forest has been acknowledged by its "
"recognition as a `UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site "

"Białowieża Forest is named after the village Białowieża, which is located"
" right in the middle of this woodland. It is one of the oldest "
"settlements in the area, nowadays hosting numerous research and tourism "
"activities. Today, there are three research institutions in the village: "
"`Białowieża Geobotanical Station, University of Warsaw "
"<https://bsg.bialowieza.pl/en/>`__, `The Mammal Research Institute, "
"Polish Academy of Sciences <https://ibs.bialowieza.pl/en/>`__, and the "
"`Forest Research Institute, Department of Natural Forests "
"<https://www.ibles.pl/en/web/guest/home>`__. Additionally, a large number"
" of scientists from Poland and abroad travel to Białowieża in order to "
"carry out their studies, and as such, there are also other users of QGIS "
"in the area, as well as additional projects which contribute to the Open "
"Data and Open Source Software ecosystems, such as the `Open Forest Data "
