"The feature-packed release of QGIS 3.26 Buenos Aires includes a vast "
"number of enhancements to a range of advanced core functionalities. This "
"includes numerous improvements to 3D capabilities, improved tooling for "
"point clouds, and the introduction of a new profile plotting framework "
"for the creation of cross-sections and elevation profiles. Best of all, "
"the new plotting framework uses the native QGIS rendering capabilities "
"and comes with all the styling, symbology, and data driven properties we "
"all know and love baked right in!"
