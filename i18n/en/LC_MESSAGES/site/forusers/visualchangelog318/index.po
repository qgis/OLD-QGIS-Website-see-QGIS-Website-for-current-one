" <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog316/>`__, QGIS 3.18 "
"introduces a host of enhancements and new features, along with a long-"

"efforts of `Lutra <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/>`__, `North Road "
"<https://north-road.com/>`__, and `Hobu <https://hobu.co/>`__, QGIS is "
"now able to import and render point cloud data in various formats by "
"leveraging the Open Source PDAL library. This functionality has been "
"introduced due to the success of a `crowd-funding campaign "
"<https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-qgis/>`__ and "
"would not have been possible without the support of the QGIS community "
"and contributors. Thank you to all those involved in realizing this "
