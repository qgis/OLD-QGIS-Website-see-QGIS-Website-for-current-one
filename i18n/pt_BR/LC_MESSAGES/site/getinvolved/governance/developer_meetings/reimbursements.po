"The QGIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically somewhere "
"in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face time for "
"developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, putting heads "
"together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our "
":ref:`QGIS_sustaining_memberships` to facilitate the event, with co-funding "
"from the host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for "
"hosting the meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by "
"donating their time and in many cases financially supporting their visit to "
"the meeting directly."
msgstr "O projeto QGIS tem reuniões de desenvolvedores a cada semestre, tipicamente em algum lugar da Europa. O objetivo das reuniões é proporcionar aos desenvolvedores um encontro cara-a-cara. É um fórum para a apresentação de novas ideias, para o planejamento, para reunir as pessoas para resolver problemas e assim por diante. Nós usamos financiamento de nosso :ref:`QGIS_sustaining_memberships` para facilitar o evento, com co-financiamento do anfitrião que normalmente fornece o local e a infraestrutura para sediar a reunião. Os desenvolvedores também co-financiam o evento doando seu tempo e, em muitos casos, apoiando financeiramente sua participação no evento."
