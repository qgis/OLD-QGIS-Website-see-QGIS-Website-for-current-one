"From analysis of the landscape metrics calculated it was found that there "
"was an increase in the degree of human disturbance and therefore a greater "
"fragmentation of uses between 1990 and 2006. The number of patches of "
"“Forest Semi Natural areas” and “Agricultural areas” decreased between 1990 "
"and 2006 (Table 1). This metric can give us some indication of ecological "
"processes increasing or decreasing relationships between populations and "
"habitats (Viana and Aranha, 2008). Also of note is the average distance "
"between spots, one measure that allows us to understand the degree of "
"landscape fragmentation, the decline of “Forest and Semi Natural areas” 1990"
" to 2006 at the expense of increased “Artificial areas” (Table 1)."
