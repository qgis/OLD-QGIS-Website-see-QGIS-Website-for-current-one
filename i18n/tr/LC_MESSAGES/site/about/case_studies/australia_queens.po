"The Southern Downs Regional Council (SDRC) is a small-to-medium sized local "
"government in south east Queensland, Australia. The council region, mainly "
"the southern part, suffers from major bushfires. Bushfire is a real and "
"present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs "
"Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property."
msgstr "Güney Downs Bölgesel Konseyi (SDRC) güney doğu Queensland, Avustralya'da bir küçük-orta ölçekli yerel yönetimdir. Meclis özellikle bölgenin güney kısmında büyük orman yangınlarından muzdarip. Orman yangınları Güney Downs Bölgesi sakinleri ve arazi sahipleri için can ve mal kaybına ve gerçek bir endişeye neden olmuştur."

"As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of "
"Queensland, the state government requires that each local government "
"identifies the bushfire hazard in their area via the State Planning Policy "
"1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide [1]. "
"This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was instead "
"done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS."
msgstr "Orman yangını sadece SDRC için değil, aynı zamanda Queensland'ın tamamı için bir sorun olduğu gibi, eyalet hükümeti her yerel yönetim için  Taşkın, Orman Yangını ve Heyelan'ıın Olumsuz Etkilerini Azaltıcı Devlet Planlama Politikası 03/01 yoluyla kendi alanında orman yangını tehlikesi tanımlamalarını gerektirir [1]. Normalde bu tür işler danışmanlar tarafından yapılabilir ama bunun yerine QGIS ve GRASS bir arada kullanılarak konseyin kendisi tarafından yapıldı."

"The QGIS GRASS plugin was used to import 5 meter contours of the whole "
