"Change log for the next release of QGIS 2.4.0. The emphasis on this release "
"has been very much on polish and performance - we have added many new "
"features, tweaks and enhancements to make the user interface more consistent"
" and professional looking (and hopefully easier to use). The composer (used "
"for creating print ready maps) has had a lot of work done to it to make it a"
" more viable platform for creating great cartographic outputs."
