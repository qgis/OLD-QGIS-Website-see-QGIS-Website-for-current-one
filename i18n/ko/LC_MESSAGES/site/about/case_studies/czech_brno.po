" obchodní a hotelová, s.r.o.) which offers higher education at tourism, "
"business and hotel management. LEAG is focused on modeling socio-economic "

" reality of localities and regions."
msgstr "실험 및 응용 지리학 연구실(LEAG)는 체코공화국(Vysoká škola obchodní a hotelová, s.r.o.) 브르노에 있는 호텔및경영대학의 일부로서, 이 대학에서는 관광, 경영 그리고 호텔 운영에 대한 고등교육을 제공하고 있습니다. LEAG는 사회-경제적 공간 처리 모델링, 공간 패턴 분석, 장소성과 지역성의 실체에 대한 묘사와 모니터링에 집중하고 있습니다. "
