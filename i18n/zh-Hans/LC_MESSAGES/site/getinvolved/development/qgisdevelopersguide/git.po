"The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during the"

"addition of a feature will have. In the past, the QGIS project had very long"
" release cycles because it was a lot of work to reetablish the stability of "
"the software system after new features were added. To overcome these "
"problems, QGIS switched to a development model where new features are coded "
"in GIT branches first and merged to master (the main branch) when they are "
"finished and stable. This section describes the procedure for branching and "
"merging in the QGIS project."
msgstr "在过去的几年里，QGIS的源代码已经变的相当复杂。因此，已经很难评估增加一个新功能会给其他部分带来多大的影响。在过去，QGIS项目每发布一个新的版本都需要很长的时间，因为新功能加入后重建软件系统的稳定性，这里面有大量的工作要做。为了解决这些问题，QGIS换了一种开发模式，也就是新功能先在git的分支库上开发，等开发完并且稳定后，才会被合并到主版本库里。这个章节描述了如何建立QGIS的分支库，以及如何合并到主版本库的步骤。"
