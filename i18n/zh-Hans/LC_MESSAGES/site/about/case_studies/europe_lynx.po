"Challenged with the task of GIS based modeling for the first time, a working"
" group of undergraduate forestry students of the University for Sustainable "
"Development Eberswalde (HNEE) conducted literature research for habitat "
"suitability and behavior of the Eurasian Lynx (*Lynx lynx*). In the module "
"‘Applied GIS in Natural Resource Management’, under the guidance of Prof. "
"Mund, the students quickly discovered the subject’s complexity, especially "
"within regard to the adaptability of species to changing environments. With "
"limited research published in English about lynx habitat on the Romanian "
"side, we continued the project based on only freely available data sets and "
"open-source software, aiming to establish conceptual knowledge of habitat "
"modeling, strengthening skills on widely applied QGIS tools and to create a "
"**basic expert model** in the process."

"Looking at the final output (Figure 3), a plausible first potential habitat "
"analysis appeared to be successful, yet more importantly, basic modeling "
"itself turned out to be less difficult than initially expected. Our choice "
"to add a sub-model for hunter accessibility allowed us to implement another "
"dimension in terms of habitat risk assessment, which can be simply nested "
"into the already existing scenario and used to determine protection "
"necessities under aspects of e.g. infrastructure development. However, some "
"crucial habitat information, such as forest structure (our highest habitat "
"suitability) cannot be derived by available data sets and in combination "
"with the complex species behavior, the result must therefore be understood "
"as basic and incomplete. Additional factors not implemented at this stage "
"are road mortality, terrain roughness and detailed prey occurrence."

"Besides its open source, free available character, QGIS software has been "
"the subject of major developments in recent years. We made very positive "
"experience with the integration of the tool box, allowing the use of various"
" GRASS and SAGA tools, even for inexperienced users. No compatibility issues"
" occurred despite changing frequently between different versions and the "
"general absence of administrative restrictions can be a powerful advantage "
"when working intuitively with data sets. We are looking forward seeing "
"further improvements, especially in regards to the integrated model builder."
