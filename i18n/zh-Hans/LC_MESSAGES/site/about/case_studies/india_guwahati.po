" Apex institute of Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. "
"Headquarter is located at Hyderabad city of India and it has three sub "
"centres at Guwahati, Jaipur and Patna city. Guwahati is capital of Assam "
"State (North Eastern side of country). The NIRD Guwahati Centre is actively "
"involved in short (mostly 5 days including one-day handheld GPS survey) "
"residential GIS trainings for State, District and Block level government "
"officials of eight North-East Indian States. Apart from government "
"officials, University faculties, College lecturers, research scholars and "
"Reputed NGOs are also trained. Trainings are fully sponsored by NIRD and "
"participants are to bear only their travel expenses. The author is working "
"in NIRD Guwahati centre as an Adjunct Faculty (GIS) and coordinating GIS and"
" Rural Development related trainings at the centre along with Dr. K. Haloi, "

"Initially I was involved in conducting GIS trainings with commercial "
"software like ArcGIS and ERDAS. But end of the training programme, "

"practice. Then we find the solution with introducing QGIS. After introducing"
" the QuantumGIS, it was felt that the Open Source GIS can fulfil the need of"
" Rural Development sector of India. Accordingly it was introduced in "
"research activities to prepare a base maps like roads, drainage, "
"settlements, delineation of watershed boundary etc. and also to prepare a "
"GPS data downloading, analysis, hyperlinking the field photos of GPS survey "
"etc. Using Google earth plugin we have been introduced to prepare a LULC "

"There is a question why QGIS only when other software like uDig, MapWindow, "
"gvSIG, GRASS are also there. The answer lies in the facts that QGIS is an "
"OSGeo incubated project, less complex, its development is very fast and "
"associated with huge community of users and developers and lastly authors "
"expertise. With its latest version of 2.4, software is capable of satisfying"
" the all needs of grass root rural development executors in India with "
"satisfying the present queries and wishes for future."
