"The Danish Demining Group (DDG), the specialised mine action unit of the "

"Samangan, and the central provinces of Kabul, Parwan and Panjshir."
msgstr "丹麦排雷组织(DDG)，作为丹麦难民理事会的特殊排雷工作组，从1999年以来一直在阿富汗开展工作，进行人道主义排雷，未爆弹药(UXO)处置与雷险教育。阿富汗地区的丹麦排雷组织通过人道主义排雷拯救生命，通过危险教育增强安全感，并帮忙消除资源生产性使用的障碍，来提升阿富汗的发展潜力。从在阿富汗开始以来，DDG已经移除了超过24000枚地雷与超过940000枚未爆弹药。最近，DDG正在巴尔赫和萨曼干的北部省份以及喀布尔，帕尔万和潘杰希尔的中部省份开展工作。"

"In Afghanistan, mineclearance activities are coordinated through the Mine "
"Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA), who collect and "
"disseminate geospatial information on known hazards (minefields, "
"battlefields, ‘spot’ UXO tasks), and update this information as clearance "
"progresses. New shapefiles of these ‘hazard polygons’ are issued by the "
"MACCA on a regular basis, and mineclearance organisations can use these to "
"assess the situation of mineclearance in their areas of operation. DDG is "
"trialling the use of QGIS within the organization to replace the expensive "
"commercial softwares it has used in the past."
msgstr "在阿富汗，通过阿富汗排雷行动协调中心(MACCA)协调扫雷活动，该中心负责收集和传播关于已知危害(雷场，战场，“现场”未爆弹药任务)的地理空间信息，并在清除过程中更新这些信息。 这些“危险多边形”的新数据文件由MACCA定期发布，而且清查组织可以利用这些文件来评估其运作地区的清查情况。 DDG正在试用组织内的QGIS，以取代过去使用的昂贵的商业软件。"

"The use of geospatial data is most useful in the planning and survey phases."
" In Afghanistan, security problems and rugged terrain mean that physical re-"
"survey of known sites is not always easy. Instead, the use of a mixture of "
"data --– satellite or aerial photography underlays, digitized Soviet-era "
"topographic maps, hazard shapefiles and digital elevation models –-- allow "
"DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield in relation to the terrain"
" and surrounding natural and physical features before sending in a survey "
"team. QGIS plugins add useful capabilities, like the ability to visualise "
"terrain in 3D. The attached screenshot above –-- made using the plugin "
"Qgis2threejs --- shows an area just south of the Darulaman Palace in Kabul, "
"with active minefields (along the ridgelines on the left) shown in red over "
"a Soviet topographic raster layer combined with SRTM data. Minefields "
"already cleared show as light green."
msgstr "地理空间数据的应用在规划与测量阶段是最有效的。在阿富汗，安全问题和崎岖的地形意味着对已知地点的实地调查总是很难。 相反，使用混合数据---卫星或航空摄影底片，数字化的苏联时代地形图，危险数据文件和数字高程模型---使DDG可以在派遣测量小组前，了解雷区的位置、地形和周围的自然和物理特征。 QGIS插件添加了有用的功能，比如以3D形式可视化地形的能力。 上面所附的截图---使用插件Qgis2threejs ---显示了喀布尔Darulaman宫殿正南方的一个区域，在苏联的地形栅格层上结合SRTM显示了红色的活动雷区(沿着左边的山脊线) 数据。 已经清除过的雷场显示为浅绿色。"

"will require eventual clearance to allow future construction within an "
"educational institution vital to Afghanistan’s future development. The "
"hazards are also notable as among the last significant remaining hazardous "
"areas in the Kabul metropolitan area. By using QGIS to combine the hazard "
"polygons from earlier surveys with highly accurate aerial photography "
"provided by the USGS, discrepancies can be noted –-- e.g. where the polygons"
" do not match the shape of the buildings, as evident in the northwest part "
"of the campus --- which can direct survey teams to places to first conduct a"

msgstr "喀布尔大学的校园仍然处在危险区域污染的猜测中 - 被认为是由空投炸弹或类似的弹药组成。 尽管这些危害不会对学生或工作人员直接造成威胁，但这些危害最终还是需要清除，以保证对阿富汗未来发展至关重要的教育机构的建设。 喀布尔大都市区最后一个重要的危险地区也是危险区。 通过使用QGIS将早期调查中的危险多边形与USGS提供的高精度航空摄影相结合，差异很明显-在校园西北部可以看出多边形与建筑物的形状不匹配 - 这可以引导调查团队到需要首先进行更准确的重新调查的地方。"

"The use of QGIS, along with a renewed interest in data analysis, has spurred"
" new ways of looking at the data available, and combining it with other data"
" sources to better target mineclearance activities. It is also driving "
"improved mapping capabilities within the organisation, and an ability to "
"better communicate the impact of its work to international donors. In a part"
" of the world where ‘formal’ GIS training is difficult to acquire, the "
"collaborative nature of the QGIS user community is greatly appreciated, as "
"technical problems can often be solved by consulting online forums. In "
"short, QGIS is playing a role in working towards ridding Afghanistan of "
"landmines and UXO."
msgstr "QGIS的运用，结合数据分析的更新状况，拓展了审视现有数据的新方法，并加以其他的数据源，可以更好的实现排雷任务。这同时促进了组内制图能力的提升，并更好的将工作成果展示给国际捐助者们。在世界上一部分难以获得“正规”地理信息系统培训的地区，QGIS用户社区的协作性值得称道，因为通过在线论坛咨询总能解决技术问题。总而言之，QGIS 正在为阿富汗地区免受地雷与未爆弹药灾害而作出贡献。"
