"Quantarctica is a collection of Antarctic geographical datasets, such as "
"base maps, satellite imagery, glaciology and geophysics data from data "
"centres around the world, prepared for viewing in QGIS. The package is "
"developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for the research "
"community, for classrooms and for operational use in Antarctica –-- freely "
"available for non-commercial purposes."

"Quantarctica (QGIS + Antarctica) was first developed for in-house use at the"
" Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for our glaciologists. There was a "
"need for a low or no cost complete GIS with essential datasets –-- ready-to-"
"use, easy-to-use, functionality rich and with offline capabilities. QGIS "
"seemed to be a perfect choice of GIS for the collected datasets."

"Quantarctica has been used to examine geographical data from continental to "
"local scales, for viewing scientific project data on top of base maps or "
"with other scientific datasets, and to prepare maps for publications and "
"proposals. Quantarctica has so far proven to be a great tool, and a very "
"good alternative and supplement to other software used by the researchers. "
"It has provided new opportunities for our researchers in their daily work."
msgstr "Quantarctica已被用于检验从大陆到本地比例的地理数据，用于在基础地图或其他科学数据集上查看科学工程数据，以及为出版物和提案准备地图。迄今为止，Quantarctica已被证明是一个很好的工具，是研究人员使用的其他软件的一个很好的替代品和补充。它为我们的研究人员在日常工作中提供了新的有利条件。"

"Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years ago, "
"there has been many requests in the research community outside the institute"
" to share this product, and we started to develop a public and improved "
"version to replace the in-house version. Following Antarctic field testing, "
"and adding new relevant datasets, Quantarctica version 1.0 was finally "
"completed and made available for download in July 2013."

"Quantarctica is to be all about community effort. With contributions we aim "
"to expand with data from other disciplines, such as oceanography, "
"atmospheric sciences, geology and biology, and hope and believe that this "

"GIS package."
