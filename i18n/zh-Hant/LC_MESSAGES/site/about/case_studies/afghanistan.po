"Samangan, and the central provinces of Kabul, Parwan and Panjshir."
msgstr "丹麥排雷小組 (DDG)，屬於丹麥難民協會下特殊的排雷行動小組，從 1999 年開始就在阿富汗工作，從事人道排雷、清除未爆彈，以及地雷風險教育。DDG 阿富汗以人道排雷拯救生命，藉由風險教育和清除障礙物強化安全意識，協助發掘阿富汗發展潛能。自從阿富汗的排雷行動開始，DDG 已經清除 24,000 個地雷，和超過 940,000 個未爆彈。目前 DDG 在阿富汗北部省份巴爾赫、薩曼甘，以及中部省份喀布爾、帕爾旺、潘傑希爾活動。"

"In Afghanistan, mineclearance activities are coordinated through the Mine "
"Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA), who collect and "
"disseminate geospatial information on known hazards (minefields, "
"battlefields, ‘spot’ UXO tasks), and update this information as clearance "
"progresses. New shapefiles of these ‘hazard polygons’ are issued by the "
"MACCA on a regular basis, and mineclearance organisations can use these to "
"assess the situation of mineclearance in their areas of operation. DDG is "
"trialling the use of QGIS within the organization to replace the expensive "
"commercial softwares it has used in the past."
msgstr "在阿富汗，排雷行動由阿富汗地雷行動協調中心 (Mine Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan, MACCA) 協調，負責收集和傳播有害物質 (地雷、戰場、發現的未爆彈) 的地理資訊。新的有害物質 shapefiles 會被 MACCA 定期公告，而排雷組織能根據這些資訊判斷他們作業區排雷狀況。DDG 打算用 QGIS 取代傳統上價格昂貴的商業軟體。"

"The use of geospatial data is most useful in the planning and survey phases."
" In Afghanistan, security problems and rugged terrain mean that physical re-"
"survey of known sites is not always easy. Instead, the use of a mixture of "
"data --– satellite or aerial photography underlays, digitized Soviet-era "
"topographic maps, hazard shapefiles and digital elevation models –-- allow "
"DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield in relation to the terrain"
" and surrounding natural and physical features before sending in a survey "
"team. QGIS plugins add useful capabilities, like the ability to visualise "
"terrain in 3D. The attached screenshot above –-- made using the plugin "
"Qgis2threejs --- shows an area just south of the Darulaman Palace in Kabul, "
"with active minefields (along the ridgelines on the left) shown in red over "
"a Soviet topographic raster layer combined with SRTM data. Minefields "
"already cleared show as light green."
msgstr "地理空間資料最有用的階段是在計畫和評估階段。像在阿富汗，安全問題和地面環境惡烈意味再次探查已知的地點很不容易。因此，用混搭的資料 --- 衛星或空照圖在下面，配合數位化的蘇聯時期地形圖，爆列物 shapefile 和數位高程模形---讓 DDG 在派送評估小組前得知雷區週遭地貌和環境，以及物理特性。QGIS 外掛有增加新的功能，像是用 3D 方式視覺化呈現地貌。附上的截---使用外掛 Qgis2threejs---顯示喀布爾達魯爾·阿曼宮南方的雷區 (位於左邊的脊線) 用紅色顏色顯示，下面則有蘇聯地形點陣圖和 SRTM 資料。已經清除的雷區用亮綠色顯示。"

"Kabul University’s campus is still contaminated with suspected hazardous "
"areas --– thought to comprise of air-dropped bombs or similar ordnance. "
"While not posing any immediate threat to students or staff, these hazards "
"will require eventual clearance to allow future construction within an "
"educational institution vital to Afghanistan’s future development. The "
"hazards are also notable as among the last significant remaining hazardous "
"areas in the Kabul metropolitan area. By using QGIS to combine the hazard "
"polygons from earlier surveys with highly accurate aerial photography "
"provided by the USGS, discrepancies can be noted –-- e.g. where the polygons"
" do not match the shape of the buildings, as evident in the northwest part "
"of the campus --- which can direct survey teams to places to first conduct a"
" more accurate re-survey."
msgstr "喀布爾大學校區仍充斥爆裂物---包括飛機的炸彈或是其他類似的彈藥。即便目前的狀況不會對學生、職員造成立即的威脅，但是仍得清理這些未爆彈，讓對阿富汗未來發展相當重要的教育機構有未來的建設空間。這些未爆彈同時也是喀布爾都會區最後僅存的雷區了。藉由使用 QGIS 結合先前找到的雷區範圍，以及 USGS 提供的高度精確的空照圖，可以看到差異---例如多邊形與建築外框無法吻合，像是校區西北角一帶---能夠指引探察小組先在這一區再一次更精確實地探察。"

"The use of QGIS, along with a renewed interest in data analysis, has spurred"
" new ways of looking at the data available, and combining it with other data"
" sources to better target mineclearance activities. It is also driving "
"improved mapping capabilities within the organisation, and an ability to "
"better communicate the impact of its work to international donors. In a part"
" of the world where ‘formal’ GIS training is difficult to acquire, the "
"collaborative nature of the QGIS user community is greatly appreciated, as "
"technical problems can often be solved by consulting online forums. In "
"short, QGIS is playing a role in working towards ridding Afghanistan of "
"landmines and UXO."
msgstr "使用 QGIS 加上看待資料分析的眼光，有了全新處理可用資料的方法，混搭其他來源的資料，則更容易鎖定掃雷。同時也提昇組織內繪製地圖的行動，和更容易與國際贊助者解釋做的工作有多重要。在全球一些地方很難取得「正式」的 GIS 訓練，QGIS 使用者社群的發揮協同合作的天性，像是透過在線上論壇詢問技術問題。簡而言之，QGIS 是阿富汗排雷和處理未爆炸的重要工具。"
