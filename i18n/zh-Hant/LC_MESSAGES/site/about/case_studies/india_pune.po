"Accessing raster/vector maps through Web Mapping Service (WMS) service is "
"very common and efficient. It has several advantages such as security, "
"centralized and flexible map styles. Example is Google maps, Yahoo, Bing, "
"MODIS, Landsat, maps published by NASA, NRSC (India). The "
"disadvantage/limitation of WMS is it works via internet or intranet. It may "
"not be possible to get internet connection always especially in the field "
"during survey. Also WMS works slow, compared to any offline image format "
"such as GeoTiff, jpg, img etc."

"QGIS provides a tool to connect/access any WMS service. WMS connection is "
"based on simple URL and once connection is established map can be seen on "
"QGIS mapview. If we save the map of visible extent from QGIS mapview as jpg "
"(File > Save as Image) it creates world file which has the geographic "
"coordinate information of particular region E.g. sample.jpg is the map and "
"sample.jpgw have the coordinates. That means the downloaded image is "
"georeferenced. We can download tiles in grid format manually and use later "
"offline. Manual downloading is possible if the area is very small or low "
"resolution images are fine."

"The script works in two simple for loops first which defines the extent of "
"map in QGIS map view and run row/columns. Once the map extent is set then "
"map is loaded in QGIS. The delay of 3 seconds (depends on internet "
"connection) was introduced before saving map as jpg in user defined "
"directory. Once the script is executed all the tiles created in directory "
"can be directly loaded in QGIS or single mosaic is prepared from Raster > "
"Miscellaneous > Merge or Build Virtual Raster (Catalog). Both tools "
"generates mosaic but basic difference in Merge creates an image independent "
"of tiles whereas Virtual raster generates a link in all individual tiles "
"(tiles are required)."

"The method has limitation that, changes in map at server end will not "
"reflect in offline (downloaded map). In this case user will have to repeat "
"the process and generate new offline map. Second limitation is the offline "
"map created will be image format; it cannot be used for thematic mapping or "

"The above experiences shows that QGIS can be used at any advanced level. "
"With basic programming skills one can write a small script or a plug-in to "
"improve the quality of work and save time. Within QGIS, access to a "
"repository of plug-ins developed worldwide is the best of QGIS. The PyQGIS "
"Developer Cookbook is a great resource to write a script and raster data "
"processing is much easy now with help of GDAL tools."
