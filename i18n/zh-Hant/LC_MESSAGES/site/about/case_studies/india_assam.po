"Nameri Tiger Reserve (NTR) is one of the 3 tiger reserves of Assam and it is"
" situated in the northern part of Sonitpur District of Assam along the "
"foothills of Eastern Himalayas. Spread over an area of 344 sq km, NTR boasts"
" rich diversity of flora and fauna. The core area of the reserve which "
"constitutes the “Nameri National Park” is bound by River Jia-Bhoreli on the "
"west and River Bor-Dikorai in the east. To the north of the Nameri lies the "
"Pakke Tiger Reserve of Arunachal Pradesh."

"Within this landscape, the principal species of conservation importance are "
"the Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian Elephant, Indian bison, Common leopard, "
"clouded leopard, Wild dog, Sambar deer, barking deer, hog deer, wild boar "
"and several other species. The bird diversity of NTR is also quite "
"impressive and more than 370 bird species have been identified so far. The "
"reserve is managed by the Assam Forest Department, Government of Assam."

"Starting with the year 2011, the National Tiger Conservation Authority "
"(NTCA) of India has made it mandatory for the all the tiger reserves of the "
"country to monitor tigers by using camera traps. Under this new protocol, 25"
" pairs of cameras will be installed for 100 sq km of tiger reserve and the "
"sampling period is 40-60 days. This new tiger monitoring protocol relies "
"heavily on the GIS."

"During 2012-13, we implemented this new tiger monitoring protocol in NTR by "
"using QGIS. To begin with, we digitized the NTR boundary in QGIS and saved "
"it as polygon. This boundary polygon was exported to GPS for navigation "
"purpose during the field surveys. We conducted an extensive sign survey in "
"NTR for evidences of tiger presence such pugmarks, scratch marks and scats. "
"GPS coordinates of tiger signs as well as suitable locations for camera "
"traps were recorded. After completion of the survey, the data was "
"transferred to QGIS using GPS tools for further processing and for "
"finalizing camera trap locations. A shape file containing the tiger signs "
"and probable camera trap locations was prepared."

"Next we prepared 4 sq km grid layer using mmqgis plugin. The shape file "
"containing results of sign survey was overlaid on the 4 sq grid to visualise"
" the distribution of camera traps in NTR. Distance matrix option under "
"vector analysis tools was quite handy for determining the inter camera "
"distance. Camera locations having less than 1.8 km inter distance were "
"removed to comply with the monitoring protocol. Due to lack of sufficient "
"cameras to monitor the entire reserve area in one go, we decided to divide "
"the reserve area into 2 blocks of 100 sq km each. Boundaries of these blocks"
" were digitised and saved as separate shape files for both the blocks. Using"
" RGB composition plugin, a false color composite of the reserve was created "
"and the sign survey shape file overlaid to assess the habitat types used by "
"the tiger. During the study period, the camera traps have to be monitored "
"intensively by the field staff. To ensure smooth functioning of monitoring "
"process, we used Voronoi polygon feature of Geometry tools and hub distance "
"of mmqgis plugin for planning logistic requirements. The geographic "
"coordinates of camera traps are required for estimating the tiger density "
"and occupancy modelling of other species. These coordinate details were "
"easily generated from camera trap shape files by using the “Export/ add "
"geometry columns” feature of vector Geometry tools."

"For the first time in the history of this small tiger reserve of North East "
"India, it was possible to monitor tigers by using camera traps mainly "
"because of QGIS. Results of this monitoring exercise indicate the presence "
"of 8-15 tigers in this landscape. In addition to the tigers, several elusive"
" species have also been photographically documented. Apart from tiger "
"monitoring, we are also using QGIS for activities such as planning habitat "
"management works, revising patrolling schedules, and designing maps for "
"visitors. The user-friendly interface, rich features, in-depth "
"documentation, on-line support  and the free/open source philosophy are the "
"few qualities of QGIS that made us to select it over other proprietary "
"software. We believe that QGIS has great potential for empowering "
"individuals/institutions/ involved in conserving endangered wildlife in the "
"developing world by offering GIS technology at little or no cost."
