"Today we can say that using QGIS was the right decision for us. QGIS offers "
"most of the features requested by our users. The Canton of Solothurn "
"subcontracts the creation of features that QGIS lacks to commercial support "
"providers. With PyQgis and PyQt there are excellent options for easy in-"
"house application development based on QGIS. One huge benefit is the "
"unlimited number of installations. Everyone who needs to use QGIS can use it"
" without any limitations. To push the development of QGIS the Canton of "
"Solothurn has invested approximately $30,000 into QGIS every year since "
"2007. This is much more efficient and target-oriented than the payment of "
"support into the black box of our former software provider. Apart from using"
" FOSSGIS, the Canton of Solothurn also provides public geodata free of "
"charge via the SO!ONLINE web portal."
