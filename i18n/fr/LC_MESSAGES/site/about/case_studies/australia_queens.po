"The Southern Downs Regional Council (SDRC) is a small-to-medium sized local "
"government in south east Queensland, Australia. The council region, mainly "
"the southern part, suffers from major bushfires. Bushfire is a real and "
"present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs "
"Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property. This project will"
" allow the council and the people of the region to be more aware of the risk"
" and to allow for better decision making in the future."
msgstr "La conseil regional du Southern Downs (SDRC) est une petite antenne du gouvernement dans le sud est de l'état du Queensland en Australie. La région couverte par cette organisation, principalement la partie sud, souffre d'important feux de brousse. Ces feux sont un serieux problème pour les résidents et propriétaires de la région."

"As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of "
"Queensland, the state government requires that each local government "

"This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was instead "
"done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS."

"QGIS, using the GRASS plugin, was selected as it provided the tools needed "
"to complete the job and the interaction between QGIS and GRASS made it easy "
"to process the raster maps and present them in a meaningful way to users. "
"SDRC uses MapInfo for its main GIS system, however MapInfo’s addons were not"
" as powerful as GRASS GIS for raster processing. The QGIS GRASS plugin was "
"used to import 5 meter contours of the whole region into GRASS which were "
"then converted into a contour raster map using r.surf.contour. A slope and "
"aspect map were then generated using r.slope.aspect from the raster contour "
"map. Categories were assigned to different slope and aspect ranges and given"
" a hazard risk sore. Vegetation areas were also given different risk scores."
" All the resulting raster maps were then combined using mapcalc and given a "
"final risk hazard score. The risk scores are then divided into three main "
"categories: high; medium; and low."

"The final part of the process was field verification via the rural fire "
"service. After the review process, QGIS was used to print the final maps for"
" presentation. As all GRASS commands can be run from the command line, all "
"the commands that were needed to generate the bushfire hazard maps were "
"recorded, for documentation purposes and for if the maps needed to be "
"regenerated some time in the future."

"Overall QGIS, together with the GRASS plugin, provided a great experience "
"and a great final outcome for the council doing their own bushfire hazard "
"mapping. The GRASS plugin provides a very easy to use interface to GRASS "
"through QGIS. As QGIS is able to open the GRASS raster format natively, "
"integration is very seamless and maps can be made with ease. The project won"
" an encouragement award at the Queensland Planning Institute of Australia "
"state planning awards in 2010 [2]"
