"Almost 35% of Switzerland's surface is covered by forests. Changing demands "
"upon the forest and the poor financial situation of forest enterprises in "
"Switzerland led to the development of a new forestry planning concept about "
"fifteen years ago. This concept introduced a clear distinction between "
"planning at the level of the authorities and planning at the level of the "
"owners1. As a new forestry planning office, guaraci works primarily in the "
"region of Basel (Switzerland) on both mentioned planning levels. This case "
"study discusses the use of QGIS at the forest owner level. On this level, a "
"simple, dynamic and compatible geographic information system is required for"
" the establishment of a forest management plan. This plan covers about 1000 "
"ha of forests, will be valid for about 20 years and is implemented by the "
"local forest manager. The area is situated in the region of Basel (see "
"google maps)."

"QGIS is an interesting tool for small planning offices, such as guaraci, as "
"well as for the forest managers and owners. It can be used in a professional"
" context and the presented output result was appreciated by all parties "
"involved. For the mentioned tasks the present QGIS version 1.4 “Enceladus” "
"offers all necessary GIS tools. The most important qualities of QGIS are the"
" intuitive user interface and the compatibility with different file formats."
" It is an ideal tool for projects that are on one hand based on existing "
"geographic data and on the other hand require the acquisition of new data. "
"The user-manual is helpful and easy to understand. Both from the technical "
"as well as the financial perspective QGIS is an interesting alternative to "
"other GIS software."

"The core tasks of a forestry planning concept can be worked out with the "
"mentioned basic GIS tools. Guaraci will continue to use QGIS for forestry "
"planning at the forest owner level. Based on the experiences with the "
"presented project, QGIS can also be recommended for forestry concepts at the"
" level of local authorities. Larger, and more complex projects with detailed"
" analysis requirements could be handled by the combination of QGIS with the "
"Postgis spatial database server. New logging zones as well as forest "
"reservates and protection zones can be easily digitized. Hopefully, forest "
"owners and managers will increasingly use the potential of QGIS also for "
"their yearly planning as well as the documentation of their forest "
"activities."
