"Every day, Ottomanists around the world generate valuable materials as "
"components of their scholarly research, but these materials may not be "
"readily available to scholars with similar interests.  The purpose of the "
"OpenOttoman (Amy Singer, OpenOttoman: A Collaborative Platform for Digital "
"Scholarship, "
"https://networks.hnet.org/node/11419/discussions/166360/openottoman-"
"collaborative-platform-digital-scholarship, 2017) is to stimulate generation"
" of such materials and provide open and convenient access to these "
"materials. The OpenOttoman Portal (http:// www.openottoman.org) (OOP) is one"
" vehicle for accessing these materials.  Materials made available through "
"the OOP include databases, with a prime example being gazetteers of Ottoman "
"world places.  Here, we describe the Historical Gazetteer of the Crimea "
"(HGC), a prototype OOP gazetteer that includes populated places, districts, "
"and provinces of Crimea in existence at the end of the Crimean Khanate."

"The primary source of data for the HGC databases is Jankowski’s dictionary "
"of pre-Russian places in Crimea (Henryk Jankowski, Historical-Etymological "
"Dictionary of Pre-Russian Habitation Names of the Crimea, Brill, Leiden, "
"2006). This source contains a map showing the locations of 137 populated "
"places, 99 of which have been associated with existing places contained in "
"the GeoNames database.  These are the populated place entries in the HGC, "
"with latitude and longitude for these entries being taken from the GeoNames "
"database."

"Jankowski’s map also shows boundaries for six provinces and 43 districts.  "
"HGC locations for these features are region centroids approximated using "

" 16 rivers shown on Jankowski’s map plus 61 additional rivers included to "
"aid in locating populated places and district and province boundaries."

"Terrain elevation data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, "
"available at https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc) was incorporated into a base "
"map of the region covered by Jankowski’s map.  District and province "
"boundaries were approximated using Jankowski’s map plus terrain features "
"such as rivers, ridge lines, and valleys where boundaries on Jankowski’ map "
"were difficult to trace.  Gazetteer locations for rivers are river mouth "
"latitude and longitude taken from the GeoNames database. Per Table 1, the "
"HGC includes three separate sets of databases which can be accessed at "
"http://epublications.marquette.edu/ottoman_crimea/.  This website also "
"provides access to a project named HGC-QGIS-Project.qgs.  Opening the "
"project in QGIS yields the result shown in Figure 1.  For the KML and shape "
"file rivers databases, rivers were traced in QGIS using the Google Maps "
"physical map."

"Per Table 2, the fields for the district, province, and river databases are "
"the same as the fields for populated places except that the Page field is "
"left blank, since districts, provinces, and rivers do not appear as entries "
"in Jankowski’s dictionary.  Districts, provinces, and rivers are assigned "
"URL IDs in the same way that they are assigned for populated places.  Thus, "
"in Table 2 the Part of field for the populated place Qarağy is the GeoNames "
"URL for Tarɣan, the district in which this place is located. The Code and "
"Class fields use the nomenclature employed in the GeoNames database.  Per "
"the example, the P code applies generally to populated places, and the PPLH "
"class (sub-code) applies to historical populated places that no longer "
"exists."

"While providing a useful gazetteer, a primary purpose of the HGC was to "
"serve as a test bed and use case for how other Ottoman world gazetteers "
"could be incorporated into the OOP.  Based on experience gained through this"
" project, a new project has been initiated to geolocate approximately 3,000 "
"populated places, rivers, river fords, rapids, islands, forests, mountains, "
"and valleys found on a set of 17th century maps of Ukraine produced by "
"Guillaume Le Vasseur, sieur de Beauplan.  This project directly supports one"
" of the principal investigator’s research on the Polish-Lithuanian "
"Commonwealth /Ottoman Empire frontier.  More generally, this work responds "
"to the need for gazetteers of the Ottoman world as expressed by the "
"OpenOttoman initiative (http://openottoman.org)."
