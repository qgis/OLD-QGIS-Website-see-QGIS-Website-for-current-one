"Environmental issues, such as the climate crisis, the rapid decrease of "
"biodiversity, and pollution are pressing issues for everyone in the "
"Geoscience community and beyond. Many QGIS users and contributors are "
"geoscientists or geoinformatics specialists. As such, we need to act "
"responsibly and serve as role models. If we act, there is a chance that the "
"members of the general public that are less informed about these issues will"
" also feel the urgency to act and help reduce the impact of human activity "
"on our planet."

"QGIS.ORG and the QGIS community are committed to act responsibly regarding "
"their actions and activities where it has any relevant influence on the "
"environment. This includes mainly our server infrastructure and our physical"

"The infrastructure provider should run the QGIS.ORG infrastructure with "
"renewable energy. Rented server or cloud resources should be sized according"

"*Choice of location:* ​ when choosing the location for a contributor "
"meeting, the remoteness of the location of the contributor meeting should be"
" factored in. Very remote places where the majority of participants have to "
"fly to should be avoided."

"*Traveling to the meeting:* ​ when feasible, participants should be "
"encouraged to choose more environmentally friendly transport options: "
"preferably trains or buses rather than planes. When choosing transport by "
"car, car pooling should be encouraged. QGIS.ORG has a program allowing "
"contributor meeting participants to ask for travel expenses reimbursement. "
"Efforts to travel with a low-impact means of transportation will be taken "
"into account for travel grant decisions. Conditions for reimbursement of "
"plane tickets :"

"no reimbursement if alternative train rides with a travel time <= 10 hours "
"exist (12 hours when including a night train connection), even if the train "
"ticket costs more than the airfare."

"When the air travel option has to be chosen and the traveller is claiming "
"travel cost reimbursements, the traveller should pay extra for a carbon "

"reimburse this extra cost."

"through scheduled discussions and video conferencing."

"*Catering:* Local organizers should organize the catering in an "
"environmentally friendly way as much as possible. Local food should be "
"preferred over food that requires significant transportation. Reusable "
"tableware, cups and cutlery should be preferred over disposable single-use "
"options as they are generally considered to be more friendly to the "
"environment. Meeting attendees should be encouraged to bring their own "
"drinking bottle and event organisers should be requested to promote using "
"potable water from the water mains system, or if that is not suitable, a "
"‘drinking fountain’ that can be used to fill up water containers without "
"generating large amounts of plastic waste."

"*Smoking and e-cigarettes:* second-hand intake of nicotine-based products "
"are hazardous to health and create an unpleasant environment for non-"
"consumers when done near them. Be respectful and do not use these products "
"in doorways or other common areas outside where non-smokers gather. "
"Organizers should rather provide a designated smoking area and request that "
"smokers and e-cigarette users refrain from smoking elsewhere."
