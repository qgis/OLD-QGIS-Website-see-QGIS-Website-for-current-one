"Over the past few years many EU countries have launched operational programs"
" to implement European Digital Agenda (EAC) developed by the European "
"Commission in 2010. According to its guidelines until 2020 every citizen of "
"the European Union should have access to 30 Mbps Internet bandwidth and at "
"least half of them will have access to bandwidth not slower than 100 Mbps."

"Poland is one of the countries in which the Agenda is being implemented. "
"Thanks to European Union funds many local operators can compete with large "
"telecom providers as regards high-speed broadband services. Unfortunately, "
"applying for funding requires a great deal of work necessary to draw up "
"proper documentation, including, among other things, development of planned "
"FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network conceptual maps."

"Moreover, currently there are no GIS-based IT tools available to support the"
" potential beneficiaries with the preparation of documentation. The "
"complexity of the problem is even more complicated by the fact that such a "
"software should enable a creation of documentation in accordance with "
"specific program guidelines (e.g. the obligation to connect educational "
"institutions)."
