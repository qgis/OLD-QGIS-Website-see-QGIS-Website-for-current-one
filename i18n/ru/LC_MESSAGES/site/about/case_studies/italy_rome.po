"This work clearly demonstrates that open source GIS tools like QGIS, GRASS, "
"GDAL/OGR, can successfully be used for spatial analysis and data processing "
"aimed at first level seismic microzonation  studies. In this example work, "
"QGIS has been used as a simplified and unified interface for different high "
"quality GFOSS tools; the Graphical Modeler allows to intuitively construct "
"geoprocessing models that can be easily shared as portable and cross-"
"platform tools that doesn't require expensive software licenses. The tool "
"leverages the QGIS modeling capabilities to graphically chain different "
"algorithms, defining input and output parameters and leaving to the software"
" the task of managing intermediate data output. The use of GRASS algorithms "
"does not require defining and using a GRASS database and mapset, greatly "
"simplifying the design of the model. Future developments include the "
"creation of a package of tools and models, based on open source software, "
"that can be used to simplify and speed up spatial analysis tasks necessary "
"for seismic microzonation studies."
