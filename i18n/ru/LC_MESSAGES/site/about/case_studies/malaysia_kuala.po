"The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia "
"(JPBD) is a federal agency that advises matters on town and country "
"planning. The scope of administration for the department however is limited "
"to Peninsular Malaysia as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia have their "
"respective town planning agencies. Town and country planning is on the "
"concurrent list in the Federal Legislation, thus, at the federal level, JPBD"
" advises the Housing and Local Government Minister from which JPBD gets its "
"patronage as well as to advise the National Physical Planning Council "
"chaired by the Prime Minister. At the state level, the state director "
"advises the State Planning Committee chaired by the Chief Minister. At the "
"local level, JPBD advises local planning authorities on planning matters by "
"being involved in the preparation of mandatory development plans. At "
"Headquarters, the National Physical Plan Division prepares the National "
"Physical Plan while four regional project offices assist in the preparation "
"of State Structure Plans, District Local Plans and Special Area Plans. As "
"public agencies were traditionally established base on their specialization,"
" JPBD is the custodian of landuse information."

"QGIS was first introduced to the Malaysian Open Source community as a viable"
" alternative to proprietary GIS for public agencies by JPBD at the Malaysian"
" Government Open Source Conference (MyGOSSCON) in 2009 and to the Malaysian "
"GIS community at the 4th National GIS Conference and Exhibition (NGIS) in "
"2010. JPBD has traditionally been a user of proprietary GIS thus the "
"introduction of QGIS was a real eye opener not only from the point-of-view "
"of Open Source Software (OSS), what more, OSS GIS. Open source philosophy "
"was different thus QGIS felt alien, unsure and unsafe, not surprisingly the "
"idea to use QGIS did not receive much support internally, in fact, it faced "
"resistance in 2010 from the top managment all the way down to the support "
"group."
