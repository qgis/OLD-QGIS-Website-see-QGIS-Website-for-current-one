"Ever since the consolidation of the Department of Geography in 2012, we have"
" tried to incorporate open source software to fulfill our duties. In "
"particular, the management of an extensive field work, consisting in the "
"annual implementation of approximately 40,000 visits to socially vulnerable "
"households throughout the country. The objective was to conform a thorough "
"georeferenced database of target households, in order to improve social "
"policies implementation. Particularly, data was collected to enhance the "
"scope of monetary transfer programs (`\"Asignaciones Familiares – Plan de "
"Equidad\" <https://www.bps.gub.uy/3540/plan-de-equidad.html>`_ and "
"`\"Tarjeta Uruguay Social\" "
"<http://www.mides.gub.uy/innovaportal/v/55480/3/innova.front/tarjeta-"

"housing, and environmental aspects."

"Although proprietary software was implemented when the working process "
"started, the development of the tasks themselves gradually demanded it to be"
" converted to open source software. As the process as a whole became more "
"computerized -incorporating a workflow engine and a PostGIS geospatial "
"database-, license requirements and benefits offered by free and open source"
" software (FOSS) options encouraged us to make the change. In that way, as "
"the QGIS project was refined (fewer bugs and more functionalities), we were "
"able to satisfy our needs using QGIS. PostGIS associated tools allowed the "
"workgroup to rapidly coordinate the tasks needed to viabilize daily field "
"trips, together with subsequent analysis tasks on the same data fieldwork "
"generated, shortly after it was relieved and digitized."

"In addition to information management and field work implementation, we "
"constantly use QGIS typical geospatial tools to produce tematic cartography,"
" and in spatial analysis tasks. This last, as much about the data that the "
"fieldwork generates, as with other ministry programs information, and "
"frequently even to aid interinstitutional projects. With `\"qgis2web\" "
"<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/>`_ we were able to produce "
"interactive maps, which have become the main way to communicate the results "
"of such investigations. They allow human resources within other programs and"
" agencies to easily and effectively manage higher amounts of information "
"than with a collection of static maps, even when these resources are not "
"used to reading spatial data."

"QGIS has become a fundamental software to the Department of Geography at "
"DINEM. It presents an excellent performance to work with heavy files and to "
"interact with PostGIS and with our workflow engine. This allows us to have "
"an excellent management of geographic data, which also makes for the "
"production of basemaps and thematic cartographies of superior quality."

"At the same time, extra features that are incorporated through plugins are "
"of great value to us. For instance, the possibility of exporting \"leaflet\""
" map viewers, as well as incorporating high resolution satellite imagery "
"directly into the GIS work area through “OpenLayers” to manually vectorize "
"information, among others."

"This variety of options is precisely what has allowed us to develop the "
"specific and at the same time very different technical solutions that "
"programs and agencies have been needing through past years.As mentioned in "
"this article, we can state that QGIS meets the necessary requirements to be "
"used in public administration as desktop GIS software. Also it has been a "
"cornerstone in helping this institution to set up a web map, offering "
"general population much information about social issues (`SIG MIDES "
