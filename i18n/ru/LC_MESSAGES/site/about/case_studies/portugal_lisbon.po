"The main goal of this platform is to provide free access to a wide variety "
"of data on biodiversity and ecosystem services for the Mediterranean Basin "
"that was scattered across a number of public and private entities. Presently"
" HABEaS WebGIS covers the south of Portugal, but by the end of 2012/early "
"2013 it will be expanded to the north of Portugal and also to the Tuzla "
"Canton in Bosnia & Herzegovina. In the long run we want to expand this tool "
"to the entire Mediterranean Basin."

"Since the main goal of this tool is to promote free and easy access to "
"information on biodiversity and ecosystem services we decided to use only "
"free and open source software, that any person or entity can use regardless "
"of their location or financial constraints. The website where HABEaS WebGIS "
"is hosted on a server that runs Debian Linux and was developed with Drupal "
"CMS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS was used to store the data and QGIS was used to "
"process and analyze the GIS that we obtained from several entities. We used "
"both QGIS's native tools but also GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through the "
"GRASS plugin and SEXTANTE Toolbox."
msgstr "Так как основная цель этого инструмента - предоставить свободный и легкий доступ к информации о биоразнообразии и экосистемах, мы используем только свободное и открытое ПО, которое может использовать любое физическое или юридическое лицо независимо от местоположения или финансовых ограничений. HABEaS WebGIS размещается на сервере, который работает под Debian Linux, сайт разработан с помощью Drupal CMS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS используется для хранения данных, а QGIS был использован для обработки и анализа ГИС, полученной нами из нескольких источников. Мы использовали как собственные инструмены QGIS, так и инструменты GRASS GIS и SAGA GIS через плагин GRASS и SEXTANTE Toolbox."

"The geographic information contained in HABEaS has also been used by WWF to "

"To determine which conservation values occure in each property we used "
"SEXTANTE Modeller to create a script that intersects all HABEaS layers with "
"the boundaries of the property. Using the same tool we were also able to "
"create a script that automatically calculates the amount of carbon that is "
"currently stored in each property."

"QGIS is easy to use and has very powerful geoprocessing capabilities. The "
"integration of GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through SEXTANTE Toolbox allowed"
" us to perform a number of complex spatial analyzes and to pipeline them "
"using SEXTANTE Modeler. It was also very easy to produce high quality maps "
"with the new Print Composer and to export them in SVG format for further "
"editing with Inkscape which is a powerful open source vector graphics "
"editor."

"In general, our experience with QGIS has been very positive, the software "
"runs smoothly and the community is very active and supportive. Reported bugs"
" are usually resolved shortly after being reported by users and QGIS "
"developers are always willing to listen to “end user's” needs and "
"suggestions."
