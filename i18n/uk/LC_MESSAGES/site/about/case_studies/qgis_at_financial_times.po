"complicated interactives (e.g. `Inside Isis Inc: The journey of a barrel of "

"news related charts and maps on a daily basis. Over the past two years I "
"have been concentrating on developing our cartographic offerings at the FT. "
"QGIS has been instrumental in changing how we produce maps, and in "
"conjunction with other tools such Blender have helped me to be more creative"
