"The Quantum GIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically "
"somewhere in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face "
"time for developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, "
"putting heads together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our "
":doc:`../sponsorship/index` to facilitate the event, with co-funding from "
"the host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for hosting "
"the meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by donating their "
"time and in many cases financially supporting their visit to the meeting "
"directly."

"'core' committers and community members of the project. However with "
"increased funding through donations and our sponsorship programme, and a "
"desire to promote new developers to get involved in the project, this policy"
" has been updated as described below."
