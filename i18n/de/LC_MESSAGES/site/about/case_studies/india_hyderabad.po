"The National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) is an Apex institute of "
"Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. Headquarter is located "
"at Hyderabad city of India and it has three sub centres at Guwahati, Jaipur "
"and Patna city. Jaipur city is capital of Rajasthan State (North Western "
"side of country). The NIRD Jaipur Centre is actively involved in short "
"(mostly 5 days including one-day handheld GPS survey and local visit) "
"residential GIS trainings for middle level government officials of North "
"Indian States. Reputed NGOs and Scholars are also trained if interested. "
"Trainings are fully sponsored by NIRD and participants are to bear only "
"their travel expenses. The author is working in NIRD Jaipur centre as an "
"Assistant Professor and coordinating GIS and Watershed related trainings at "
"the centre. Initially at the time of his posting at Headquarter of NIRD at "
"Hyderabad, he was involved in GIS trainings with commercial software like "
"ArcGIS and ERDAS. After getting opportunity of a two days training on "
"QuantumGIS at IIT Madras in 2009, it was felt that the Open Source GIS can "
"fulfil the need of Rural Development sector of India. The version learnt in "
"training was QGIS 1.0.2. The training feedback was provided to seniors and "
"it was recommended to introduce QGIS in further trainings but apprehensions "
"were there in accepting the software in mainstream of trainings. Software "
"was then pursued for the personal use for one year and its new versions were"
" checked for the enhanced functionalities. During this whenever author was "
"course coordinator in training, he used QGIS in trainings for introduction "
"and feedbacks."

"Since creation of NIRD Jaipur centre, only QuantumGIS is being used for all "
"GIS trainings at the centre. Further it is being messaged and advised in all"
" trainings that no commercial GIS software should be purchased at District "
"(administrative unit in India after Nation and State) and below, if real "
"requirement is not felt and this saving may be used for purchase of hardware"
" like GPSs, computers etc."

"There is a question why QGIS only when other software like uDig, MapWindow, "
"gvSIG, GRASS are also there. The answer lies in the facts that QGIS is an "
"OSGeo incubated project, less complex, its development is very fast and "
"associated with huge community of users and developers and lastly authors "
"expertise. With its latest version of 1.8, software is capable of satisfying"
" the all needs of grass root rural development executors in India with "
"satisfying the present queries and wishes for future."
