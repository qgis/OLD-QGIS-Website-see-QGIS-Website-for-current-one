"The Missouri Herpetological Atlas Project (MOHAP) was initiated in 1997 as a"
" result of the desire to obtain and easily update detailed distribution maps"
" for Missouri (United States of America) amphibians and reptiles. A database"
" was established to store all valid localities, including records published "
"in historical literature sources and specimens vouchered from museums. From "
"the database, a series of maps can be produced representing both locality "
"records and \"county records\" for each species."

"MOHAP hosts a web site at http://atlas.moherp.org/ that describes the "
"project in detail and displays a variety of static maps, all produced by "
"QGIS.  An atlas, published as a downloadable PDF, is released periodically "
"as a gratis publication in the spirit of open access to scientific research "
"(Daniel, R.E. and B.S. Edmond. 2012. Atlas of Missouri Amphibians and "
"Reptiles for 2011. <http://atlas.moherp.org/pubs/atlas11.pdf>).  Published "
"maps are used by field biologists, land managers, and others to better "
"understand species' distributions in Missouri."

"As of February 2013, the MOHAP database contained 31,495 entries "
"representing the specimens housed in 34 museum collections and cited in 32 "
"historical literature sources; 5,118 documented county records; 6,884 unique"
" localities; and 12,866 unique species / locality combinations. The state's "
"herpetofauna consists of 113 species."

"The process of creating maps with QGIS starts with data stored in several "
"PostgreSQL tables, spatially-enabled with PostGIS. Because maps are static "
"and ultimately destined for either the web or a printed atlas, they are "
"generated automatically for each species using a custom QGIS Python plugin "
"(Figures 1,2)."

"The final species maps have a clean and professional appearance (Figure 3). "
"To better understand species' distributions, a series of base maps are also "
"created and labelled (Figure 4). Because of the way styles are managed "
"within each data layer, the base map layers can also be incorporated into a "
"set of species maps with little extra effort."
