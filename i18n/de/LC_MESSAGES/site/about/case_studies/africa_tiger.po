"The Water Observation and Information System (WOIS) is an open source "
"software tool for monitoring, assessing and inventorying water resources in "
"a cost-effective manner using Earth Observation (EO) data. The WOIS has been"
" developed under the TIGER-NET project, which is a major component of the "
"TIGER initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) and whose main goal is "
"to support the African Earth observation capacity for water resource "
"monitoring. TIGER-NET aims to support the satellite-based assessment and "
"monitoring of water resources from watershed to cross-border basin levels "
"through the provision of a free and powerful software package, with "
"associated capacity building, to African  authorities."

"The WOIS can be seen as a multipurpose system consisting of a spatial "
"database, facilities for extracting and processing EO data, and integrative "
"tools and models aimed at decision support e.g. hydrological modelling and "
"GIS-embedded visualization and analysis tools. The WOIS is designed around "
"QGIS, which acts as the front-end Graphical-User-Interface (GUI).  QGIS was "
"chosen as the central integrating platform, due to its clear and accessible "
"GUI, strong development community, ease of implementing additional "
"functionalities through Python plugins and its high level of "
"interoperability with major GIS data formats through the use of the "
"Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) library."

"Moreover, the integrated Processing Toolbox, formerly known as SEXTANTE, "
"brings the ability to easily incorporate geoprocessing algorithms from "
"various applications into QGIS. It acts as a joint repository for a wide "
"range of algorithms, some native to QGIS and others imported from external "
"applications, such as GRASS GIS or the Orfeo Toolbox. Support for algorithms"
" from ESA’s BEAM, NEST and Sentinel-1 Toolbox software and for setting up "
"and executing SWAT based hydrological models was added to the Processing "
"Toolbox during the WOIS development. The toolbox also allows for easy "
"incorporation of custom R and Python scripts. The inputs and outputs of the "
"Processing Toolbox algorithms can be evaluated with the QGIS capabilities of"
" data I/O, rendering or map creation."

"A key advantage of the Processing Toolbox is the ability to seamlessly use "
"functionalities from different algorithm providers for data processing and "
"analysis. This can be used to create automatic processing models and, "
"through a QGIS plugin developed during the TIGER-NET project, to "
"sequentially combine algorithms from the different providers into wizard-"
"based processing chains. This functionality was used to create a library of "
"standardized workflows (with instructions) for performing common but complex"
" tasks related to EO data analysis within water resource management."

"The operational and practical use of the WOIS to support integrated water "
"resource management in Africa has been demonstrated via a series of user "
"specific demonstration cases covering a wide range of themes and information"
" products. These include: lake water quality; flood monitoring; land "
"degradation and land cover characterization; water bodies mapping and "
"hydrological modelling. The demonstration cases have several stages. First, "
"customized end-to-end processing workflows are developed for the requested "
"products and applications. Those workflows are subsequently used for product"
" derivation over significant areas and time periods as requested by the "
"users. In the final step, the workflows (i.e. their stability/performance "
"and ease of use) as well as the product outcomes are being evaluated in "
"close dialogue with the users."

"The development of the WOIS represents a successful example of a user-driven"
" and collaborative development model, where functionalities have been "
"designed, developed and evaluated through user-designated cases in order to "
"demonstrate the real impact of the system on enhancing water management and "
"integrated water resource management plans. The WOIS is already implemented "
"in major African river basin authorities, several African ministries and "
"agencies, as well as in research and humanitarian organizations. It will "
"therefore continue to develop in response to continued user requirements for"
" new functionalities and functional improvements and due to general "
"software, algorithm and method enhancements."

"A particular focus will be on ensuring the support and implementation of "
"processing capacity for the new Sentinel satellite system by integrating the"
" ESA Sentinel toolboxes into WOIS and developing dedicated production "
"workflows. The next release of WOIS (due in the second half of April 2015) "
"will already incorporate Sentinel-1 Toolbox and a number of workflows "
"utilizing this new radar dataset for flood monitoring, water body mapping, "
"etc. This will turn WOIS into a fully-operational monitoring system. Through"
" provision of this license-free, powerful and extendable system, and through"
" continued capacity building and training efforts, the project thrives to "
"build the basis for an extension, i.e. roll-out to other countries and "
"regions in Africa and beyond."
