"The Research Institute for Geo-hydrological Protection of Turin (IRPI), "
"member of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), started its "
"activities in 1970. The skills gathered since its foundation concern various"
" following investigation sectors, e.g. the study of geological and "
"hydrogeological features of the Alpine-Po river system (Northern Italy) or "
"the monitoring, prediction and prevention of natural disasters. These tasks "
"are carried out by the employment of a multidisciplinary approach including "
"hearth sciences, engineering and geomatic."

"In order to carry out exhaustive researches and studies, in addition to "
"field survey, modelling and historical records analysis, aerial photograms "
"are employed. Their use varies, from “simple” visual analyses to complex "
"processing as stereoplotting or image segmentation."

"The institute, for the explained purposes, keeps in its archive about "
"170000, recent and historical, photograms --- the oldest one dating back to "
"1920s (Figure 1) --- covering, in different years, the Po basin or part of "
"it. Some photograms cover other basins in northern Italy. In addition the "
"archives keeps flight plans of the described photograms (Figure 1)."

"In order to cope with such amount of data a GIS approach was adopted. First "
"each flight plan, showing photograms’ footprints, was scanned, georeferenced"
" and digitized in shapefile format. Then photograms were scanned, at 600 "
"DpI, and files were named according to a code including map sheet, year of "
"acquisition, strip number, photogram’s serial number and code of property "

"Each footprint in digitized flight plan was provided, in its attributes, "

"interface to search and refer to (Figure 2). Data concerning photogram code "
"were stored in attribute table fields than, by field calculator, a “Link” "

"Moreover, due to the amount of searchable data a geographical search "
"interface was developed. Thanks to the graphical modeler (in Processing, "
"formerly SEXTANTE, plugin) capabilities, the developed tool, by different "
"selection masks and input boxes, allows the user to select among three "
"layers (administrative boundaries, map sheets and rivers), find a feature by"
" querying its table and employ it to spatially query a digitized flight plan"
" with the purpose of selecting photograms’ footprints intersecting the "
"selected feature (Figure 3). With this procedure, is then possible to point "
"out selected photogram and simply display them with the previously described"
" tool or extract, by their filenames and path, photograms’ files for further"
" processing."

"The photogram collection is of great interest both in research (e.g. Godone "

"2009 the photograms were employed in several projects both internal and "
