"I started applying GIS to my work in biogeography about 10 years ago. "
"Through my graduate internship, PhD work and two other research jobs, I used"
" the proprietary software packages that were available and used at my "
"workplaces – mainly CartaLinx, Idrisi, ArcView and ArcGIS. But I found it "
"rather annoying that we were constantly dealing with license renewal issues,"
" and that I could not use the software away from the workplace unless I "
"acquired my own license."

"It crossed my mind on several occasions that switching to free software "
"would spare me those problems. However, there was prejudice against the "
"analytical capabilities of free software, and even after I heard about the "
"potential of GRASS, I was still reluctant because I thought it would be too "
"difficult to learn. I was also afraid it would be cumbersome to migrate all "
"the maps and analyses that I had done so far. At the beginning of my post-"
"doc in 2008, I finally gave it an opportunity and took a training course on "
"QGIS and GRASS. It was probably the best decision of my professional life! I"
" found that QGIS provided a very intuitive interface for GRASS, hat they "
"complemented each other perfectly, and they provided all the analytical "
"capabilities I needed. I started using both programs immediately after the "
"course. Not only did I begin all my new GIS work with QGIS/GRASS [e.g. 1,2],"
" but I also did follow-up analyses on previous works that I had done with "
"commercial software. For example, I had built models of otter [3] and desman"
" [4] distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. After switching to QGIS-GRASS, I"
" analysed how those models behaved when downscaled to a finer resolution "
"[5]. Another previous work on biogeographic relationships between Iberian "
"lynx and rabbit [6] had a follow-up after I switched to QGIS-GRASS [7]. Not "
"only did I not have any problems with the migration of the data and previous"
" results: I also found it much easier to do the things I wanted to do with "
"the new software, and was able to do extra analyses which I could not have "
"done with the programs I used before."

"All in all, switching to QGIS/GRASS brought me nothing but advantages. I can"
" now work freely at work, at home and on my laptop on the move, without "
"having to worry about software licenses or moving to new institutions. Open-"
"source software covers all my research needs and gives me the freedom I "
"longed for."
