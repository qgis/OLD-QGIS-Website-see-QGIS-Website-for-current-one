"Amurum forest reserve is located near the city of Jos, Plateau state, "
"Nigeria. It was established in conjunction with the initiation of the A.P. "
"Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI) for the purpose of "
"natural conservation, education and research. APLORI is hosted by the "
"Department of Zoology at the University of Jos. Yearly a group of "
"approximately eight highly motivated students from all over Nigeria obtain "
"training in conservation biology, statistics (with R) and as of 2011 GIS as "
"well. During two weeks in December 2011 we studied basic GIS concepts and "
"applied those with QGIS for various conservation purposes. In this article "
"we describe the way in which we used QGIS to map the habitats and its "
"determinants of Amurum reserve and how the basic habitat maps were used to "
"obtain strata for the purpose of efficiently determining the spatial "
"distribution of the avifauna including the biodiversity."

"Overall, the elevations of the SRTM data set corresponded well to the gps-"
"collected elevations. Terrain models in GdalTools were used to calculate "
"hills hades and slopes for the area. These variables are important from an "
"ecological point of view because they are strongly associated with the type "
"of habitat."

"Since we intended to develop a good-looking map, we interpolated the "
"original (clipped) elevation map to obtain a higher resolution map. We used "
"the warp tool in GdalTools. By means of the contour tool we obtained smooth "

"Coordinates of the boundary of the reserve were obtained by walking along "
"the boundaries of the reserve with a GPS. The waypoints and tracks stored in"
" the GPS were smoothly imported using the GPS Tools. The imported waypoints "
"and tracks were used to construct a polygon shapefile. The tracks inside the"
" reserve were mapped in a similar fashion."

"We were able to quickly and precisely construct a habitat map of Amurum "
"using a Google satellite image which we got into the workspace with the "
"Openlayers plugin. The reserve has three types of distinct habitat: "
"Savannah, Gallery forest and Rocky outcrop. On the basis of the satellite "
"image we used the editor to draw polygons demarcating the three habitats. "
"Setting the snapping options correctly allowed the construction of non-"
"overlapping polygons."

"The random points in fTools were used for this purpose. All the locations "
"were visited during two mornings by four groups of students (2 per group) "
"giving a total of 38 random locations dispersed throughout the reserve. The "
"observation data were entered in a spreadsheet and analyzed using R. In "
"addition, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated using R. After "
"merging the location file with the resulting observation data it was "
"exported as a csv file which was loaded into QGIS using the “Add delimited "
"text layer” tool. On the basis of the above mentioned layers a map was "
"constructed presenting some of the most important landscape features and "
"avian diversity of the Amurum reserve."

"Overall, the course was a great success. We - a group of students with no "
"previous GIS experience - enjoyed working with QGIS a lot. Within just two "
"weeks time we were able to develop an extremely useful map of the reserve. "
"Amongst others, the extents of the various habitats were determined which "
"allows for stratification and thus for better estimates of abundances of "
"various kinds of organisms. Basically we are now able to do better "
"ecological research using QGIS as an open source platform."
