  the new PSC member’s place. Outgoing PSC members that were previously voting
  members will need to be re-elected into the voting membership should they wish to
  return to their former role.

6 Sustaining Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sustaining members are members who support QGIS.ORG financially with an annual membership fee. This membership fee is used to cover expenses of QGIS.ORG infrastructure, events and other initiatives to improve the project. Membership fees help to ensure that the QGIS community and the software we produce can be maintained and improved in a sustainable way. Sustaining members have no voting rights (unless they are simultaneously voting members in which case their voting rights are unaffected).

The following categories are offered for sustaining members, based on their size and assigned through self declaration:

* Small (e.g. for smaller cities or companies up to 10 employees)
* Medium (e.g. for universities, medium size cities or companies up to 50 employees
* Large (e.g. for larger cities, provinces or companies up to 100 employees)
* Flagship (e.g. for companies larger than 100 employees, federal governmental organizations)

Membership fees are approved or changed by the general assembly. They are defined as minimum fees per category, but may be increased if the sustaining member chooses to do so.

Because QGIS.ORG is a world-wide project and different companies, NGOs or governmental organizations have different financial prospects, we do not enforce any membership levels - the organizations pick their own membership level based on self-assessment.

Acceptance of sustaining members shall be subject to the discretion and approval of The Board, who reserve the right to accept or reject applications for sustaining membership and ongoing support memberships as deemed appropriate.

The fees for membership levels and guidelines for management of sustaining members are provided in the governance section of the QGIS.ORG website.
