QGIS error on your machine. How to ask a question?
..................................................

Please provide the following information:

- preferably a descriptive title for your email
- which Operating System and version
- which QGIS version (exact)
- how you installed it (osgeo4w? msi-installer? own build?)
- at what time did it break (reinstall, new install, system update, project??)
- what exactly is the error (not sure in the above if you mean that "python error' is the error, or you mean there is a python error which you did not write in you email

Without this info, it is very hard to answer for anybody. Or, taking just too much time because the answer will be a question to you etc etc.
