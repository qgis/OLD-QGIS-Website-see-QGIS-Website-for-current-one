.. _QGIS-sustaining_members:

Sustaining members, sponsors and Donors
=======================================

We thank our sustaining members, sponsors and donors who support the QGIS project and enable us to pay
for our infrastructure and important development work, as well as finance developer
meetings and promotion of QGIS in workshops and conferences. Note that we are currently in a transition
phase changing from a sponsor system to a system with sustaining members. This should make it easier
for public authorities to support the QGIS.ORG project by becoming a sustaining member. For many public
organizations it was difficult or impossible to sponsor or donate to a project.

Organizations who supported QGIS before March 17, 2019 are still sponsors, after that date we introduce new supporters
as sustaining members.

For information on becoming a sustaining member, please visit :ref:`QGIS_sustaining_memberships`.

List of donors
--------------

Donations can be of any amount, via our bank account, Stripe or Paypal
(information available at :ref:`Donations <QGIS-donations>` page).
Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the
bank account or stripe (if you want to do credit card payments) rather than PayPal (they have higher
payment fees and an unnecessary currency conversion is involved). Please
contact finance@qgis.org if you want to pay larger amounts with credit cards through Stripe.
We can send you a payment link and/or invoice.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in several countries.
Please refer to your local tax office for details.
