QGIS Installers
===============

How to obtain QGIS?

QGIS is freely available on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, BSD, and Android.

We recommend installing the packages of the released software.

To evaluate the upcoming release and to allow non-developers to support
development we also provide testing packages (note the
warning_).

In the feature frozen phase preceding a release (see
:ref:`QGIS-release-schedule`) these packages are effectively **pre-releases,
which we strongly urge users to test**.

.. _QGIS-windows-testing:

Windows
=======

For Windows installers please go to
`The main installers page <./download.html>`_.

For new users we recommend the standalone installers.

For more advanced QGIS users you can use OSGeo4W packages, which make it
possible to install several versions in parallel.

The OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects.
QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc.
The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed
packages beforehand.
The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations.
Steps are:

- Download OSGeo4W Installer (`32 bit <http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe>`_ or
  `64 bit <http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup-x86_64.exe>`_) and start it
- Select *Advanced Install*,
- navigate to the *Desktop* section
- and pick one or more of the following packages:

.. _QGIS-windows-weekly:

For users that cannot use OSGeo4W for some reason or just prefer it there is
also a `weekly snapshot <https://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/?C=M;O=D>`_ of
qgis-dev from OSGeo4W as *standalone installer* (taken on monday).  In the
feature freeze phase that also acts as **release candidate**.

Note the warning_.

.. note:: Don't blindly do a full install of OSGeo4W. Only install QGIS and
   maybe other components you like.  Dependencies will be included
   automatically.  A full install pulls in components that require third party
   additions, which need to be installed manually.  These components render the
   installation unusable without those additions.

Linux
=====

Most linux distributions split QGIS into several packages; you'll probably
need qgis and qgis-python (to run plugins).
Packages like qgis-grass (or qgis-plugin-grass), qgis-server can be
skipped initially, or installed only when you need them.

Below you find instructions to install per distribution.  For most distro's
there are instructions to install QGIS stable and instructions to install a
cutting edge QGIS testing build (note the warning_).


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

Default Debian and Ubuntu software repositories often hold older versions of
QGIS.

To have newer versions, you have to add alternative software repositories, by
adding one of the deb-lines below to your /etc/apt/sources.list file.

Our main repository contains multiple lines of packages for several versions of
**Debian and Ubuntu** based on the dependencies the individual distributions
provide.

For Ubuntu we also have extra packages in a separate repository that are based
on `ubuntugis <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis>`_, which holds more uptodate
versions of other GIS packages than Ubuntu itself. If you want those you also
need to include ubuntugis ppa in your /etc/apt/sources.list file (see
`ubuntugis documentation
<https://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/UbuntuGISRepository>`_).


.. note:: The packages are only produced once shortly after a new version has
   been released.  As unstable, not yet released debian versions (testing) and
   ubuntugis can have library changes the packages might sooner or later be
   broken, when the development in debian, ubuntu or ubuntugis moves on and their
   packages used as dependencies in qgis change.  In that event you can either

   - move to a stable debian version and use the released packages for it,
   - wait for the next point release (due |nextpointreleasedate|), which
     happens every month and will include the updated dependencies,
   - switch to the nightly repository whose packages are rebuild on regular basis
     and will also pickup the updated dependencies automatically or
   - build your own set of packages (see INSTALL_).

Add the lines for one of the repositories to your ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

 deb     *repository* *codename* main
 deb-src *repository* *codename* main

Example latest release for Debian jessie::

 deb     https://qgis.org/debian jessie main
 deb-src https://qgis.org/debian jessie main

After that type::

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass

.. note:: Please remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have
   installed from other repositories before doing the update.

In case of keyserver errors add the qgis.org repository public key to
your apt keyring, type::

 wget -O - https://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2017.gpg.key | gpg --import
 gpg --fingerprint CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45

Should output::

 pub   2048R/BDF7FB45 2017-08-16 [expires: 2019-08-16]
       Key fingerprint = 61E0 A086 749E 463E DE50  2255 CAEB 3DC3 BDF7 FB45
 uid                  QGIS Archive Automatic Signing Key (2017) <qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>
 sub   2048R/E959BBCF 2017-08-16 [expires: 2019-08-16]

After you have verified the fingerprint you can add the key to apt with::

 gpg --export --armor CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45 | sudo apt-key add -

Alternatively you can download the key from a keyserver and add the key to apt
in one go (without manual fingerprint verification)::

 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qgis.qgis

.. warning::
   There is currently no support for Android 5. Best support is given for
   Android 4.3 and 4.4.x.
   This is a direct port of the QGIS desktop application. It is only slightly
   optimized for touch devices and therefore needs to be carefully evaluated
   for its suitability in day-to-day use. There are other apps available which
   are designed and optimized specifically for touch devices.

QGIS Testing warning

.. _warning:

.. warning::
   QGIS testing packages are provided for some platforms in
   addition to the QGIS stable version.
   QGIS testing contains unreleased software that is currently being worked
   on.
   They are only provided for testing purposes to early adopters
   to check if bugs have been resolved and that no new bugs have been
   introduced.  Although we carefully try to avoid breakages, it may at any
   given time not work, or may do bad things to your data.
   Take care. You have been warned!
