QGIS Installers
===============

How to obtain QGIS?

QGIS is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.

We recommend installing the packages of the released software.

To evaluate the upcoming release and to allow non-developers to support
development we also provide testing packages (note the
warning_).

In the feature frozen phase preceding a release (see
:ref:`QGIS-release-schedule`) these packages are effectively **pre-releases,
which we strongly urge users to test**.

Windows
=======

There are two options for installations on Windows:

Standalone installers
---------------------

For beginners the easiest way is using the standalone installers:

+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Release           | Version                      | Package                                        |
+===================+==============================+================================================+
| Latest Release    | |release| |codename|         | `Installer <lr_msi_>`_ `Checksum <lr_sha_>`_   |
|                   | |releasenote|                |                                                |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Long Term Release | |ltrrelease| |ltrcodename|   | `Installer <ltr_msi_>`_ `Checksum <ltr_sha_>`_ |
|                   | |ltrnote|                    |                                                |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Development       | |devversion| master          | `Weekly snapshots <weekly_msi_>`_              |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

See also `The main installers page <./download.html>`_.

The weekly snapshots of the nightly qgis-dev package of OSGeo4W are for users
that cannot use OSGeo4W (see below) for some reason or just prefer standalone
installers. In the feature freeze phase that also acts as **release
candidate**.

OSGeo4W installer
-----------------

More advanced QGIS users should use OSGeo4W packages, which for one make it
possible to install several versions in parallel and also to do much more
efficient updates as only changed components are downloaded and installed.

The OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects.
QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc.
The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed
packages beforehand.
The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations and
could also be used to install offline.

Steps are:

- Download `OSGeo4W Installer <https://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/v2/osgeo4w-setup.exe>`_ and start it
- Choose *Express Install* and select *QGIS* to install the *latest release*
  and/or *QGIS LTR* to install the *long term release*.

Alternatively to *Express* you also use the *Advanced Install*, navigate to the
*Desktop* section and pick one or more of the following packages:

+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

| Development       | |devversion| master          | qgis-dev [1]_          | Nightly build of the development version              |
+-------------------+------------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

.. [1] Nightlies are debug builds (including debugging output)

The packages listed in the table only install the necessary packages to run
QGIS.  Corresponding to those packages there are also meta packages with
the postfix ``-full-free`` and ``-full``.   The former contains additional optional
dependencies that some popular - not included - plugins use and the latter
include the former and also add proprietary extensions like Oracle, ECW and
MrSID.

The Express installs reference the corresponding ``-full`` variant and the
standalone installers are also made from these OSGeo4W package sets.

Before installing any of the nightly builds note the warning_.


Linux
=====

Most linux distributions split QGIS into several packages; you'll probably
need qgis and qgis-python (to run plugins).
Packages like qgis-grass (or qgis-plugin-grass), qgis-server can be
skipped initially, or installed only when you need them.

Below you find instructions to install per distribution. For most distro's
there are instructions to install QGIS stable and instructions to install a
cutting edge QGIS testing build (note the warning_).


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

Quickstart
..........

.. note:: In the section following this one, you will find ALL possible options to
   install different versions of QGIS in different versions of Debian/Ubuntu. If you
   have problems, verify there whether your distribution is still supported as the
   repositories also contain older **unsupported** distributions with the last
   QGIS version that was supported. Beware that those might have meanwhile
   ceased to work.

Here you will simply install the latest stable QGIS (|version|.x |codename|)
in your Debian or Ubuntu without having to edit config files.

.. note:: Although you see 'Debian' in some places, this also works for
   'Ubuntu', as one is actually a symlink to the other on our server.

First install some tools you will need for this instructions::

 sudo apt install gnupg software-properties-common

Now install the QGIS Signing Key, so QGIS software from
the QGIS repo will be trusted and installed::

 sudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings  # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer
 sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

Add the QGIS repo for the latest stable QGIS (|version|.x |codename|) to ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources``::

  Types: deb deb-src
  URIs: https://qgis.org/debian
  Suites: your-distributions-codename
  Architectures: amd64
  Components: main
  Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

.. note:: ``Suites`` in above lines depends on your distribution. ``lsb_release -cs`` will show your distribution name.

   In some distributions (like Linux Mint), ``. /etc/os-release; echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME"`` will show the correct distibution name.

   See `Available codenames`_.

Update your repository information to reflect also the just added QGIS one::

 sudo apt update

Now, install QGIS::

 sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass

.. note:: Add ``qgis-server`` to this line if you also want to install QGIS Server


Repositories
............

Default Debian and Ubuntu software repositories often hold older versions of
QGIS.

To have newer versions, you have to add alternative software repositories, by
adding one of the deb-lines below to your ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources`` file.

Our main repository contains multiple lines of packages for several versions of
**Debian and Ubuntu** based on the dependencies the individual distributions
provide.

For Ubuntu we also used to have extra packages in a separate repository that
are based on `ubuntugis <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis>`_, which held more
uptodate versions of other GIS packages than Ubuntu itself for LTS versions. If
you want those you also need to include ubuntugis-unstable ppa in your
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.list file (see `ubuntugis documentation
<https://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/UbuntuGISRepository>`_).


.. note:: The release packages are only produced once shortly after a new
   version has been released.  As unstable, not yet released debian versions
   (testing) and ubuntugis-unstable can have library changes the packages might sooner
   or later be broken for these targets, when the development in debian, ubuntu
   or ubuntugis-unstable moves on and their packages used as dependencies in qgis
   change.  In that event you can either

   - move to a stable debian version and use the released packages for it,
   - wait for the next point release (due |nextpointreleasedate|), which
     happens every month and will include the updated dependencies,
   - switch to a nightly repository (available for the **two** release
     branches and master) whose packages are rebuild on regular basis and will also
     pickup the updated dependencies automatically or
   - build your own set of packages (see build-debian-packages_).

  uid           [ unknown] QGIS Archive Automatic Signing Key (2022-2027) <qgis-developer@lists.osgeo.org>

After you have verified the output you can install the key with::

  sudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings  # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer
  sudo cp qgis-archive-keyring.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

Alternatively you can download the key directly without manual verification::

  sudo mkdir -m755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings  # not needed since apt version 2.4.0 like Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22 or newer
  sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

With the keyring in place you can add the repository as ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources`` with following content::

  Types: deb deb-src
  URIs: *repository*
  Suites: *codename*
  Architectures: amd64
  Components: main
  Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

Example for the latest long term release for Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy::

  Types: deb deb-src
  URIs: https://qgis.org/ubuntu-ltr
  Suites: jammy
  Architectures: amd64
  Components: main
  Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg

After that type the commands below to install QGIS::

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass

In case you would like to install QGIS Server, type::

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install qgis-server --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests
  # if you want to install server Python plugins
  apt install python-qgis

.. note:: Please remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have
   installed from other repositories before doing the update.

   to check if bugs have been resolved and that no new bugs have been
   introduced.  Although we carefully try to avoid breakages, it may at any
   given time not work, or may do bad things to your data.
   Take care. You have been warned!
