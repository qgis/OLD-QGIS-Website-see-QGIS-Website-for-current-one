   :alt: 

Feature: Expression field (virtual fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you want to have an attribute that is calculated and that is
always 'fresh' - reflecting the current state of the feature properties.
Now you can add virtual fields to your table which are based on an
expression.

Feature: Legend improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second phase of the legend / table of contents overhaul has been
completed. This includes:

-  API cleanup (for developers)
-  Scale-based filtering of legend nodes (in WMS)
-  Visibility groups of map layers in layer tree. This new toolbar
   button allows quick changes between the groups of layers that should
   be visible.
-  Ability to manage layer groups from the legend toolbar
-  The new legend filter option on the legend toolbar will remove legend
   items for any classes which are not currently in the view extent.
   This is an awesome improvement as it ensures that your map legend
   does not contain entries for items not currently in the map view. It
   is available in the main map legend and in map composer and for WMS
   layers.
-  Rule-based renderer legends can now be displayed in in a pseudo-tree

Map Composer
------------

Feature: Control over hiding print composer items from prints/exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have added a checkbox and data defined button for controlling whether
an item is excluded from composer exports/printouts. If the item is
unchecked it will be visible at composition design time only.

   :alt: 

Feature: Item tree panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The item tree panel in the map composer allows for selection of items,
hiding/showing items, toggling lock status of items and double-clicking
to edit item id. You can also use drag and drop to reorder items.

   :align: center
   :alt: 

Feature: Composer Table improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You can now set table header and content font colors.
-  Tables can now be split across multiple frames, allowing their
   content to be distributed over columns or over different pages.
-  Added option show headers on first frame, all frames, or no frames.
-  Allow manual control of column widths.
-  New options for table source, including current atlas feature and
   child features from a relation.
-  Choice of behaviour for empty tables, include hiding the entire
   table, showing empty cells, or displaying a set message in the table
   body.
-  Added a checkbox to filter table features to those which intersect
   the current atlas feature.
-  Added checkbox to remove duplicate rows from table.

Note that tables in existing projects are not automatically updated to
the new table format which supports these features, and tables must be
readded to a composition for the new settings to appear.

Feature: Composer improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The map composer (used to prepare printable map compositions) has
received a number of improvements in QGIS 2.6.

-  You can now change the secondary fill color for scalebars
-  Holding shift while drawing line/arrow items constrains drawing to
   horizontal, vertical or 45 degree angles
-  Holding shift while drawing other new items constrains them to
   squares, holding alt causes item to be drawn from the center
-  Right click no longer locks/unlocks items, this is now handled by the
   new items panel. Locked items can no longer be selected from the
   composer canvas, allowing for interaction with items below them.
-  Holding alt while pressing cursor keys results in a 1px movement for
   items
-  Removed the destructive 'Load from template' menu item, replace with
   a new non-destructive 'Add items from template' action

   :alt: 

Feature: Improved item snapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapping thresholds are now set in pixels, allowing for finer movement
and resizing of items when zoomed in to a composition.
 Items within a group are no longer used for auto snap lines.

   :alt: 

Feature: Multiple overviews for a map item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is useful to be able to show more than one overview frame
for a map frame. For example if you want to show where your map is in
local, regional and global context, using multiple overview maps can
help you to achieve this. As of QGIS 2.6 you can now achieve this by
assigning as many maps as you like to the 'overview' role in your
composition.

   :alt: 

Feature: HTML item improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of useful new options for the HTML composer item:

-  Option for manual entry of HTML source
-  QGIS expressions within HTML source can be evaluated prior to
   rendering HTML content
-  Data defined URL for HTML source
-  Allow for creating a user stylesheet to override HTML styles

   :alt: 

Feature: Composer map grid improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You can now have multiple grids with different properties.
-  You can mix reprojected grids and Lat/Long grids.
-  You can use standard QGIS symbology grid lines etc.
-  There is a new frame/annotations only grid style. Selecting this
   style causes only the frame and annotations to be drawn, with no grid
   lines or other markings over the map.
-  There are now options for controlling which side of a map item the
   frame is drawn on.
-  There are new tick styles for frames, with inner ticks, outer ticks
   and both inner and outer tick options.
-  We have made improvements to grid annotations, including many new
   formats for annotations.
-  Grid annotations now use the typographically correct prime and double
   prime symbols for grid annotations.

   :alt: 

Feature: New modeler implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modeler has been rewritten, and now provides extra functionality
such as allowing nested models with no depth limit. Models are now
stored as JSON files. Backwards compatibility is kept, so all models can
still be used. You can also now drag and drop items from the inputs and
algorithms onto the modeler graph.

Feature: Single select feature tool merged into select by rectangle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have merged the single selection tool into the rectangle tool. If you
want to select a single feature, simply enable the rectangle tool and
then single click (rather than dragging a rectangle) a feature.

   :alt: 

Feature: Add layer to map canvas behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many of QGIS' dialogs that generate a new layer, the 'Add layer to
map canvas' checkbox is now checked by default so that the new layer
automatically gets added to the map.

Feature: Add icon size 48 and 64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those using QGIS on touch devices (or if you just like big, chunky
icons), you can now set the icons up to 64 x 64 pixels in size.

.. figure:: images/entries/3be3f51da2f54a8395f054f757f9fae1948a6103.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Feature: New colour buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is probably one of the most useful new features in QGIS 2.6 -
especially if you are involved a lot in cartography work. The colour
button used everywhere in QGIS has been enhanced, with drop down menus,
colour swatches, default colours, etc. Click on the drop down item to
the right of the colour button to see the quick options. Click on the
button to the left of the colour widget to see a standard colour chooser
dialog.

Feature: Context menu for identify tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the identify tool, you can now right click on the canvas to
use the identify tool in context mode. In the menu that appears you can
define which feature types you wish to identify (all all if you like).
