.. note
    here we put Download QGIS in h1 because we want it to be a h1 in the menu in the tocbar
    Content is not used, it is overridden by text in themes/qgis-theme/forusers_download.html.
    The html texts are translated in the 'sphinx' resource: https://www.transifex.com/qgis/qgis-website/sphinx/
    Only TOC is used.

.. note
    here we put a toctree just to have the alldownloads page in a toc, thereby in the tocbar
