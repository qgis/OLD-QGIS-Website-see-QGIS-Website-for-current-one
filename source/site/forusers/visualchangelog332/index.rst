Changelog for QGIS 3.32
=======================

|image1|

Release date: 2023-06-26

QGIS 3.32 is a major release of the QGIS Project that brings a significant advancement in geospatial technology to the Open Source World. The developer community has introduced several new features and improvements to leverage the potential of geospatial data.

Amongst numerous quality of life improvements across a broad spectrum of existing features, the 3.32 release features the long awaited functionality for Native Point Cloud Processing in QGIS, allowing QGIS Desktop to become a powerful processing utility for LiDAR data.

This milestone achievement is thanks in large part to the contributions of the community to the effective `crowd funding campaign <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__ which funded this development, the QGIS community and `Enhancement Proposals <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/263>`__ used for the effective governance of these contributions, the collaborative efforts of the development agencies involved, and of course the extraordinary contributions of individual developers who build these tools for the benefit of all.

This release also includes a wide variety of developer experience enhancements, extensions to new functionalities like the profile plots and processing frameworks, and a new framework for sensor data to tightly integrate QGIS with data collection apparatus and facilitate the creation of next-generation intelligent solutions.

For a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the highlight reel video on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtE1Az-zpf0

3D Features
-----------

Feature: Improved 3d measure tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following improvements have been implemented to the measuring tool in 3d scenes:

- Allows measuring on point cloud points
- Display billboard circle markers on the 3d rubber band's vertices
- Moving the mouse moves the rubber band's last vertex (although the measured results are not updated until user clicks)
- Moving the camera does not remove current measurements
- Allows using backspace and del keys to undo (remove last measurement)
- Allows using Esc to clear measurements, matching the behavior of its 2d counterpart
- Renders 3d rubberbands on top of other 3d entities so they don't get occluded

The object selection logic has also been refactored for more control, and the 3d identify tool was also enhanced to prevent interference with camera navigation as well as a bug fix for where the wrong FIDs were returned on specific cases.

|image13|

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Stefanos Natsis <https://github.com/uclaros>`__

Point Clouds
------------

Feature: Native point cloud Processing provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new native processing provider has been provided for point cloud algorithms, in line with `QEP 263 <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/263>`__.

Under the hood provider utilizes the `pdal_wrench <https://github.com/PDAL/wrench>`__ command line tool and currently supports the following algorithms:

- Information: outputs a basic metadata of the point cloud (number of points, extent, crs, etc)
- Convert format: convert point cloud to a different format, e.g. las to laz
- Reproject: reproject point cloud to a different CRS
- Fix projection: fix (assign) CRS of a point cloud file
- Clip: clip point cloud by clipping polygon(s)
- Merge: merge multiple point clouds in a single file
- Tile: create tiles from input data
- Thin: create a thinned version of the point cloud
- Boundary: export vector layer containing point cloud boundaries
- Density: export a raster file where each cell contains number of points that are in that cell's area
- Export to raster: export point cloud data to a 2D raster grid
- Export to vector: export point cloud data to a vector layer with 3D points
- Export to raster (TIN): export point cloud data to a 2D raster grid using a triangulation of points
- Filer: extract subset from the point cloud using PDAL expressions

As pdal_wrench requires PDAL >= 2.5.0, the new processing provider will be available only where the PDAL version requirement is satisfied.

|image14|

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Point cloud expression builder for Processing framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new point cloud expression builder widget is available within the GUI to create filters for point clouds in a user friendly manner consistent with the existing QGIS Expression Builder interfaces.

Within the QGIS API, the ``QgsProcessingParameterExpression`` parameter has been extended with the types ``Qgis`` and ``PointCloud``. If parameter has a ``PointCloud`` type, it will use the point cloud expression builder widget. To maintain backward compatibility, by default an expression parameter will use the ``Qgis`` expression type.

The ``QgsPointCloudExpression`` class was also extended with a new method to convert QGIS point cloud expressions to `PDAL expressions <https://pdal.io/en/latest/stages/expression.html>`__.

Existing PDAL algorithms using expression filters have been updated to use expression parameters instead of strings.

|image15|

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Add filtering by rectangle and expression to PDAL algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added the option to filter input point cloud by rectangle (extent) and expression in the following PDAL algorithms:

- boundary
- clip
- density
- export to raster (normal and TIN variants)
- export to vector
- merge
- thin

This allows the processing of only a subset of points from the input file(s), without the need to performing an intermediate filtering step or generating temporary files.

For these who need only filtering there is also a separate Filter algorithm capable of filtering either by extent, by expression or by their combination.

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: New parameter type for point cloud attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Useful for point cloud algorithms involving attributes, like exporting specific attribute values as raster or filtering point clouds.

This also deprecates ``parameterAsFields`` API call, and ``parameterAsStrings`` should be used both for fields and point cloud attributes instead.

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Display virtual point clouds (VPC) in 3D views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual point clouds can be rendered within 3d views. For performance management, a sub index threshold is specified so that the view will render the chunked entity of the point cloud only when appropriate and will instead render the bounding region of a particular sub index when the threshold criteria is not met.

|image16|

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Stefanos Natsis <https://github.com/uclaros>`__

Feature: Virtual point clouds (VPC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new data provider is available for *Virtual Point Cloud* (VPC) files created by the `pdal_wrench <https://github.com/PDAL/wrench>`__ utility and the *Build virtual point cloud (VPC)* tool in the newly introduced `Native point cloud Processing provider <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/263>`__.

The VPC file is handled as a single layer in QGIS and may contain a large number of point cloud files whose indexes are lazy loaded when the canvas is zoomed in enough. An extent renderer is used for the individual indexes while their extent fits the canvas' width and the user defined renderer is only used when zoomed in further.

A Virtual Point Cloud is a JSON container file with a ``.vpc`` extension, referring to other files/URLs that contain the actual point cloud data. This is a concept similar to virtual rasters (VRTs) in GDAL. The JSON content is actually a STAC API ItemCollection. See `VPC specification <https://github.com/PDAL/wrench/blob/main/vpc-spec.md>`__ for more details.

Print Layouts
-------------

Feature: Hyperlink support for HTML-enabled label exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QGIS labels which contain HTML content will now support embedding functional hyperlinks in relevant layouts exports, such as PDFs.

This feature was funded by Kanton Schaffhausen

This feature was developed by `Mathieu Pellerin <https://github.com/nirvn>`__

Feature: Support filtering layout legends by multiple linked map items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of limiting layout legend filtering to a single linked map, this change permits legends to be filtered instead by multiple linked maps. It is designed to accommodate the use case where a layout has multiple maps, potentially at different scales and showing different extents, and a single legend is required which includes all symbols visible across all the maps.

The UX has been designed to avoid changing the current user workflows, in that legends will still be linked to a single main map item. This map is used when determining the scale (and other map dependent properties) at which to render the legend's symbols. Checking the "Only show items inside linked maps" option will still automatically filter the legend by the content of the main linked maps. However, there's a new "..." options button next to the "Only show items inside linked maps" checkbox which allows users to select also other maps from their layout to consider when determining visible items:

Expressions
-----------

Feature: Add ltrim/rtrim functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows trimming spaces or other characters from just the start or end of strings

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Digitising
----------

Feature: Field value list in merge feature dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When merging features, users may now select from a list of available values from the selected features, rather than manually capturing a manual value for a field.

|image19|

This feature was developed by `Denis Rouzaud <https://github.com/3nids>`__

Feature: Common angle option extensions for advanced digitizing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advanced digitizing options for common angles have been extended with the following functionalities:

- New common angles for 0.1°, 0.5°, and 1.0°
- A new option has been added to show current common angle in the floater context widget
- New 'N' 'SHIFT+N' keyboard shortcuts are available to cycle through the common angle options

|image20|

This feature was funded by ChartWorld International

This feature was developed by `Alessandro Pasotti <https://github.com/elpaso>`__

Feature: Floater settings and bearing information for advanced digitizing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new configuration setting for the advanced digitizing tool allows users to toggle the display of the "floater" contextual menu which follows the cursor during digitizing. Additional options are included for adding information to the floater panel, such as the display of bearing and azimuth information.

This feature was developed by `Alessandro Pasotti <https://github.com/elpaso>`__

Data Management
---------------

Feature: Allow a range of cells to be copied from SQL results window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows selection of a range of cells to copy to clipboard. Results are copied as both plain text and html, so can be pasted easily into spreadsheet apps/etc as tables

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Modified New field dialog behavior and alias support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating new fields, the 'Comment' option is now only exposed for datasources which support editing comments (preventing QGIS from silently discarding the information).

This also adds support for setting field aliases within the new field dialog, and extends field comments and aliases for supported OGR formats.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Add DistanceUnit value for inches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inches are now included as valid map units within QGIS.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Record split policy selection in form dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new "field split policy" choice item is exposed in the layer properties form dialog. That allows users to easily determine the current policy for splitting a field and change as required.

The following policies have been provided:

- duplicate values
- remove values
- use default value
- use ratio of geometries

|image22|

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Forms and Widgets
-----------------

Feature: Add control over horizontal / vertical stretch for attribute form widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This functionality exposes two new "size" options for edit form widgets, allowing control over the horizontal and vertical stretch factors for the widget. By setting a horizontal or vertical stretch, users can control how edit widgets will relatively resize when resizing an attribute form.

For example, a user can set a higher horizontal stretch value for widgets which should "grab" more of the available horizontal space, such as for those widgets which are expected to have longer values. Similarly, the vertical stretch setting (available for select widget types) will control how widgets grow vertically when resizing forms, relative to the form dialog.

Together these options give more control to users over the exact layout and sizing of their attribute forms.

By default, the stretch values are set to "Default" which is the same as the behavior exhibited in previous versions of QGIS.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Add new attribute form container type "Row"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This container always lays out child widgets in a horizontal row, where the number of columns is automatically determined by the number of child widgets.

It's useful for creation of compact forms, where no space will be wasted by assigning extraneous horizontal width to widgets where the expected values will always be short.

Eg: creating 3 rows with 3, 2, 1 child widgets respectively results in the layout:

::

    Attr 1: [...] Attr 2: [...] Attr 3: [...]
    Attr 4: [..........] Attr 5: [..........]
    Attr 6: [...............................]

Without the option of row containers then the all horizontal rows will have the same number of columns, eg:

::

    Attr 1: [...] Attr 2: [...] Attr 3: [...]
    Attr 4: [...] Attr 5: [...] Attr 6: [...]

(leaving insufficient horizontal length for attributes 4-6), or

::

    Attr 1: [..........] Attr 2: [..........]
    Attr 2: [..........] Attr 3: [..........]
    Attr 4: [..........] Attr 5: [..........]
    Attr 6: [..........]

(resulting in wasted horizontal space next to attribute 6, and an extra row taking up vertical space)

This feature was funded by NIWA

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Processing
----------

Feature: Download vector tiles algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new Processing algorithm has been added which enables the downloading of vector tiles from a remote server. This functionality includes vector tile support for the map layer parameter, as well as a new vector tile destination parameter for Processing algorithms. The output MBTiles format files can also be automatically added to the canvas after processing.

This feature was funded by `Mergin Maps <https://merginmaps.com/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Allow configuration of the order of outputs created by a model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new "Reorder Output Layers" action to the model designer menu has been added which allows model creators to set a specific order which the outputs from their model must use when loading the results into a project. This gives the model creator a means of ensuring that layers are logically ordered on the canvas when running a model, such as placing a vector layer output over a raster layer output, or a point layer over a polygon layer.

The model creator can also set an optional "Group name" for the outputs for automatically grouping outputs within the layer tree using a new group name or by adding them to an existing group.

|image23|

This feature was funded by `QGIS User Group Germany <https://qgis.de/>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Algorithm to create COPC files for input point clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new algorithm adds the "Create COPC" option to the PDAL provider for generating Cloud Optimized Point Clouds. The algorithm creates a COPC file for each input point cloud file and can be useful for indexing files before using them in QGIS, or when building a VPC.

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Add invert selection tool on refactor fields processing tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new button has been added to the field management interface of the refactor fields processing tool button which allows users to invert the selection. This allows for more efficient management of fields such as enabling bulk field deletes.

This feature was added during the `QGIS Contributor Meeting 2023, s-hertogenbosch <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/25th-Contributor-Meeting-in-'s-Hertogenbosch>`__

|image24|

This feature was funded by `camptocamp <https://camptocamp.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Ismail Sunni <https://github.com/ismailsunni>`__

Feature: Support field comments and aliases in processing algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This adds support for handling field comments and aliases in the processing "add field to attributes table" and "refactor fields" algorithms. Additionally, it ensures that field comments and aliases are copied from source layers to destination layers when present.

If the output layers do not support comments/ aliases then user-friendly warnings are shown in the processing log advising users of the limitation.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Build virtual point cloud (VPC) algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new algorithm allows user to build `virtual point cloud (VPC) <https://github.com/PDAL/wrench/blob/main/vpc-spec.md>`__ files that reference multiple existing point cloud datasets. This allows then visualization and processing of many point cloud files as a single layer in QGIS.

Additional options are available for the "Build VPC" Processing algorithm, which provide the following utilities for building Virtual Point Clouds:

- calculate statistics from input data
- calculate exact boundaries from input data
- build an overview point cloud

This feature was funded by `Point cloud processing and 3D data enhancements crowdfunding <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/pointcloud-processing-qgis/>`__

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Thread management in algorithm settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A handy new environment configuration setting has been created for the configuration of the number of threads an algorithm should use when an algorithm is capable of using several cores, such as TauDEM or PDAL.

This functionality has been applied to the PDAL and TileXYZ algorithms.

|image25|

This feature was developed by `Alexander Bruy <https://github.com/alexbruy>`__

Feature: Allow temporary folder to be temporarily changed through the algorithm settings panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Individual processing algorithms may now include an environment setting to specify a custom temporary folder which overwrites the configured temporary file path. This is useful in situations where a particular tool may use a lot of temporary disk space and a dedicated location or scratch disk is required, or when a particular operation requires performance enhancements offered by a particular disk or path.

|image26|

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Allow processing dialog to override default processing context settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new "Algorithm Settings" action has been added to the Advanced button of the processing algorithms interface. Selecting it shows a panel which allows users to control general processing settings which apply to a **particular instance** of the algorithm execution. It's intended to be a place where a user can override their global processing settings on an ad-hoc basis without having to change their usual default settings.

Includes settings for:

- invalid geometry handling (Unlike the existing per-parameter setting override for this, setting the handling method here will apply to ALL inputs for the algorithm)
- distance unit and area units to use for distance/area measurements

|image27|

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Additional parameters for gdal2xyz algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The gdal2xyz processing algorithm from the GDAL processing provider now includes parameters for ``skipnodata`` and ``src``, and ``dstnodata``.

This feature was developed by `Luke Pinner <https://github.com/lpinner>`__

Feature: Add "Keep disjoint results separate" option to buffer algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If checked, then any disjoint parts in the buffer results will be output as separate single-part features. This setting is designed to expose a similar functionality as is available for the 'dissolve' algorithm.

This feature was funded by City of Canning

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Allow filter expressions to be set for vector sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change adds a new "feature filter" option alongside the existing feature limit and invalid geometry handling options available for all vector inputs to processing layers.

It allows users to enter an expression to subset the layer dynamically when running the tool, avoiding the need for separate steps to set layer filters or create layer subsets.

|image28|

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Support \*.HEIC format images in Processing "Import Photos" algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Import Photos algorithm now allows importing ``*.heic`` images with GDAL's HEIF image support.

This feature was developed by `Chris Shucksmith <https://github.com/shuckc>`__

Application and Project Options
-------------------------------

Feature: Settings editor updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interface for settings editors have seen a major overhaul and the advanced settings interface has the following user facing changes:

- A choice of using the old or the new settings widget, which is remembered
- A "hidden" setting allows to bypass the warning before showing the settings tree
- Settings have dedicated editors (spin box, checkbox, colorbutton, etc.)
- The modification of settings is now only executed when apply is pressed
- Current settings are displayed in italic, whereas settings to which changes will be applied are displayed in red

In addition, the settings API has undergone significant changes including:

- Removal of the QgsSettingsEntryByValue class, using the by reference only
- The old QgsSettingsTreeWidget has been renamed to QgsSettingsTreeWidgetOld (in app)

New API classes introduced include:

- QgsSettingsTreeWidget and QgsSettingsTreeModel: tree widget + model to show and edit the settings
- QgsSettingsEditorWidgetWrapper (pure virtual): a base wrapper class to create and handle a setting editor widget
- QgsSettingsEditorWidgetWrapperTemplate (pure virtual): the base class for the wrapper of settings declared in C++ API (using typed methods)
- Classes for settings editors: QgsSettingsStringEditorWidgetWrapper, etc.
- QgsSettingsEditorWidgetRegistry: a registry of the setting editor wrappers

|image29|

This feature was developed by `Denis Rouzaud <https://github.com/3nids>`__

Feature: User profile selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous versions of QGIS, when QGIS Desktop was closed the current profile would be saved in the profiles.ini configuration file, so the default profile was the profile used in the last instance of QGIS that was closed.

A new User selection policy feature allows users to select how default profiles are defined, in accordance with the following three options:

- Last Profile: The legacy mode which follows previous version behavior. This uses the last closed profile when opening a new instance of QGIS.
- Default Profile: Manually define a default profile among the existing profile that will always be used by default (without using a command line flag or electing a profile from within the QGIS UI)
- Let user choose at startup

When "Let user choose" is selected, if there are 2 or more profiles, a selection dialog is displayed before the SplashScreen which will allow the user to choose which profile to use or to create a new profile which will be loaded automatically.

Regardless of the selected policy, if only one profile exists it will be used, and if no profile exist, the default profile will be created and used.

User profile icons are also provided to allow users to visually differentiate between their active profiles.

|image30|

This feature was developed by `Yoann Quenach de Quivillic <https://github.com/YoannQDQ>`__

Profile Plots
-------------

Feature: Distance unit selection for elevation profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users may now choose from a selection of distance units to override the default (Canvas CRS map units) for elevation profiles in both the interactive elevation profiles (via the settings toolbar button) and for layout elevation profiles.

In layout profiles, there is an additional option which controls where the distance unit suffixes should be placed. The following options are available to manage the display of unit suffixes:

- hide the suffixes
- display for all values
- display for the first value
- display for the last value
- display for both the first and last values.

Note that it is currently not possible to expose unit selection for the vertical axis, as this is currently dimensionless and will require the development of vertical CRS handling in QGIS as outlined in `QEP 267 <See%20https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/267>`__.

Feature: Export elevation profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new item has been added to the elevation profile toolbar, which includes various options for exporting elevation profiles.

Profile plots can now be exported as:

- 3D Features: exports the profile line as 3d cross sections, with z values taken from the elevation slices
- 2D Profile: exports the profile as a distance vs elevation chart (i.e. as shown in the elevation profile widget)
- Distance/Elevation Table: exports sample distance vs elevation values as a table

The results can be saved as DXF files, CSV files, or any of the standard writable vector spatial formats shapefile geopackages.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Add layers to elevation profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. An explicit "Add Layers" button has been added to the elevation profile dock. This provides a user-friendly why of adding new layers to a plot - clicking it will show a filtered list of possible layers which can be added to the plot, but which currently aren't in the plot (i.e it will include all raster layers from the project which aren't marked as having elevation data). Selecting layers will cause them to automatically be marked as having elevation data and immediately added to the plot.
#. Layers can now be added to elevation plots via drag and drop from the layer tree. Unfortunately, users will have to explicitly hold the "Ctrl" key while dragging in order to force the copy action due to upstream library limitations.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Add "Fill Above" mode for elevation profile drawing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new fill above drawing mode for profile plots also includes additional options to limit the extent of "fill above" and "fill below" elevation ranges for a layer.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Add option to lock the horizontal/ vertical scale to matching scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When activated, this option ensures that the horizontal and vertical scales are always kept equal. For instance, a 45 degree slope will always appear as a 45 degree slope in the profile.

Sensors
-------

Feature: Core sensors framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A core sensors framework provides a sensor types registry, a sensor manager, and three simple QIODevice-based sensor types as follows:

- TCP socket
- UDP socket
- Serial port

A sensor manager is attached to project instances that allows users to register sensors within their project files. Contrary to other inputs such as a positioning device, sensors are considered to be much more project-specific data inputs. The big advantage of project-based sensors is that it makes those much more portable and easier to share across users.

A new ``sensor_data()`` function is added to the project scope which is available using expressions, that returns the latest captured sensor data values for a specific sensor name. An optional expiration (in milliseconds) parameter allows for expressions that will reject a specific sensor value is older that the provided expiration value.

Browser
-------

Feature: Set field comments in browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When supported by providers, a new browser context menu action for fields allows for users to set/change the field's comments in the datasource.

Currently supported for OGR formats with field comment capabilities such as GPKG, ESRI File Geodatabase, NetCDF, or Geoparquet, as well as PostgreSQL data sources.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Set field aliases in browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When supported by providers, a new browser context menu action for fields allows for users to set/change the field's alias in the datasource.

Currently supported for OGR formats with field comment capabilities such as GPKG, ESRI File Geodatabase, NetCDF, or Geoparquet.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Data Providers
--------------

Feature: Load layers in parallel threads when opening project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QGIS will now load supported layers in parallel when loading a project, significantly improving project load times in certain instances such as when a project includes numerous remote layers.

To load a layer on a parallel worker thread, the layer data provider must support parallel loading (currently GDAL and PostgreSQL providers).

A new advanced setting is available to deactivate this behavior when necessary.

This feature was developed by `Vincent Cloarec <https://github.com/vcloarec>`__

Feature: Implements server-side filtering using Part 1 or Part 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WFS/ OGC API for Features (OAPIF) data provider has been extended to support enhanced filtering criteria in line with open standards.

New functionalities include:

- Support for filtering on feature properties (OGC API Features Part 1 - /rec/core/fc-filters). This uses the /api endpoint to get the list of queryable items.
- Support for filtering based on OGC API Features Part 3 - CQL2-text
- Pass selected CRS to query builder UI
- Implement a getFeature() expression translation

For the CQL2text compatibility, the server ``/conformance`` implementation is required to declare at least the following data:

- http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-3/1.0/conf/filter
- http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-3/1.0/conf/features-filter
- http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/cql2-text
- http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/basic-cql2

The ``/collections/{collid}/queryables`` endpoint is requested to get the queryable properties.

Additional conformance classes for advanced filtering include the following items:

- http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/advanced-comparison-operators: for IN, BETWEEN, LIKE
- http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/case-insensitive-comparison: for ILIKE
- http://www.opengis.net/spec/cql2/1.0/conf/basic-spatial-operators: for ``intersects(geomcolumn, geomFromWkt('POINT(x y)'))`` and ``bbox_intersects(geomcolumn, geomFromWkt('WKT LITERAL'))``

This feature was developed by `Even Rouault <https://github.com/rouault>`__

Feature: Expose option to load vector tile sources from files in Data Source Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Vector Tile tab now includes choices for selecting from a "Service" (the existing, connection based approach for adding vector tiles from online sources) or "File" (a new option which allows directly adding a data source using VTPK or MBTiles vector tile files).

|image35|

This feature was funded by Landesamt für Vermessung und Geoinformation, Feldkirch, Austria

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Additional user controlled vector tile properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vector tile data sources now support user defined controls for layer opacity and blending modes.

Additionally, it adds the standard "Source" and "Rendering" tabs to the vector tile layer properties dialog. The Rendering tab contains the layer's scale based visibility (just like for other layer types), and the source tab contains the layer name, crs override and provider-specific source controls.

Source widgets are also for the VTPK and MBTiles vector tile providers, allowing control over the source vtpk/mbtiles file path.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Fix broken layer support for vtpk/mbtile vector tile layers, show vtpk files in browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vector tile layers now expose all the required API items for supporting broken layer handling and discovery, making their behavior consistent with other layer types. Additionally, by implementing the modern provider metadata APIs for the VTPK provider we ensure that VTPK files are shown in the browser panel for easy discovery.

QGIS Server
-----------

Feature: PDF format options for WMS GetPrint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FORMAT_OPTIONS`` parameter in QGIS Server can now also be used to pass format options for PDF format to WMS GetPrint.
This allows more control in GetPrint requests when generating GeoPDF outputs, such as Georeference or Geometry Simplification settings.

This feature was developed by `mhugent <https://github.com/mhugent>`__

Feature: Configurable capabilities cache size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The QGIS Server GetCapabilities request cache size can now be configured with the ``QGIS_SERVER_CAPABILITIES_CACHE_SIZE`` parameter, which uses an integer input specifying the number of requests to cache. A notice of "Removed cached WMS capabilities document" will be logged when all slots are taken and a cached document is dropped.

This feature was developed by `Jürgen Fischer <https://github.com/jef-n>`__

Feature: Add display name in GetFeatureInfo response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``WITH_DISPLAY_NAME`` parameter will add the display name in the ``GetFeatureInfo`` response if needed, similar to the existing ``WITH_MAPTIP`` parameter.

This feature was funded by `3liz.com <https://3liz.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Étienne Trimaille <https://github.com/Gustry>`__

Feature: OGC API - Features: Add full pagination for collection items HTML page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make browsing the features more user friendly and provide more information, the following was implemented and added to the HTML template:

- full pagination which shows always the total number of pages
- configurable pagesize via dropdown
- number of matching items
- number of returned items
- pagesize/pagination controls also at the bottom of the page

|image36|

This feature was developed by `Björn Hinkeldey <https://github.com/pathmapper>`__

Programmability
---------------

Feature: Python console help improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A special ``?`` command has been added to the python console which displays a useful help message, identifies some key variables, and provides helper functions for improving the developer experience within QGIS Desktop.

The ``_pyqgis`` and ``_api`` helper functions will take a parameter (an instance or class), and will display the matching object page from the QGIS or Qt documentation.

|image37|

This feature was developed by `Yoann Quenach de Quivillic <https://github.com/YoannQDQ>`__

Feature: Run shell commands from the Python Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The QGIS Python ConsoleMimics IPython behavior to run system commands.

- Run any command that works at the command-line with the syntax ``!<cmd>``. The console will start a subprocess, and forward its output to the Python Console Output.
- While the subprocess is running, the Python Console Input switch to STDIN mode and forwards entered character to the child process. This make it possible to send confirmation when the child program ask for it.
- This provides easy access to commands such as pip for the simple installation and removal of dependencies directly within the QGIS project context
- When the Console is in STDIN mode, pressing Ctrl+C will kill the subprocess.
- Affect the result of a command to a variable with the syntax ``var = !cmd``

|image38|

This feature was developed by `Yoann Quenach de Quivillic <https://github.com/YoannQDQ>`__

Feature: Reformat code action for code editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A "format code" action has been added to the Python Console Editor which allows for the automated linting/ pretty printing of code in line with the capabilities of modern code editors.

Additional configuration settings for this action include:

- Format on save: if enabled, formatting is applied just before saving the script
- Sort imports: Sort import statements using isort
- Max line length: Control how the formatter will wrap the lines, and controls the editor ruler

The Formatter options allow for a selection between the autopep8 or black linting tools and provide the following additional options:

- Level (autopep8 only) See `Autopep8 aggressiveness level <https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/#more-advanced-usage>`__
- Normalize quotes (black only): Replace all single quotes with double quotes if possible

Sorting operations are provided using isort, which will allow for sorting import statements in three different groups:

- standard library imports (re, os, sys, json, ...)
- third-party modules (PyQt5, pandas, dateutil, ...)
- first-party modules (qgis, processing, ...)

These operations will facilitate consistent development in line with industry best practices and improve code quality, consistency, readability, and operational efficiency (especially when coupled with version control systems).

This feature was developed by `Yoann Quenach de Quivillic <https://github.com/YoannQDQ>`__

Feature: Toggle Python console to full main window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds the same toggle button 3d map canvases and attribute tables to make it super-easy to switch the Python console to a full main window or back to a docked widget.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson <https://github.com/nyalldawson>`__

Feature: Reformat HTML Code in Code Editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Editors using the ``QgsCodeEditorHTML`` class will be able to use the code reformatting functionality to pretty print HTML data within QGIS. Note that this functionality will require the BeautifulSoup4 or lxml libraries to be installed within the python environment to parse the XML/ HTML data.

This feature was developed by `Yoann Quenach de Quivillic <https://github.com/YoannQDQ>`__
