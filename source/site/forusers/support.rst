User Groups
-----------

Local QGIS user groups are a great place to meet other users.

See :ref:`QGIS-usergroups` to read about it.


Website
-------

The website should be used to publish any material in relation to the information
and management of the user group. Examples include the user meetings, case study,
shared material, discussion boards, etc. Public material should be available without
login requirements (e.g. do not require interested people to be a member of a social
media network like Facebook or Google+). Usage of social media is recommended but
should not be the only channel of information. RSS feeds should be made available
at the Website of the QGIS user group.


Good luck with the organization of your local user group. Please inform the
international QGIS team by registering at the QGIS community list and reporting
about your progress. Please do not hesitate to ask questions regarding the
establishment and maintenance of your local user group.
