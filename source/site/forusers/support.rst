Mailing Lists
-------------

QGIS has a bunch of mailing lists. See :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists` for the different available lists.

If you are going to ask questions please read this: :ref:`how-to-ask-a-QGIS-question`.


Searchable Mailing Lists
------------------------

Nabble (http://nabble.com) keeps a history of a lot of mailinglists.

If you go to
the osgeo section of it: http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/ you see there is a
QGIS section also, where you can do a search over all QGIS lists, or refine it
to e.g. only the users list.


StackExchange
-------------

On http://gis.stackexchange.com you can ask QGIS questions also. If you use the
tag ``qgis`` you'll see all QGIS related questions and answers:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/?tags=qgis


Chat
----

Telegram
........

There is a lot of user and community related chat (english spoken) on the Telegram channel you can join here:
https://t.me/joinchat/Aq2V5RPoxYYhXqUPoxRWPQ

To join: install Telegram on your phone, register and join via link above.

There is also a web version (https://web.telegram.org) which you can join in the browser (after you joined telegram via your phone(number)).

Matrix
......

Matrix (https://matrix.org) is another project for decentralised chat. QGIS has a channel there **#qgis:matrix.org** on which there is a bot which echo's the IRC channel and vice versa.

To join: create an account (at matrix.org is easiest, but if you have an osgeo account you can also use your osgeo id as matrix id), install a client (Elements is easiest, but see https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/#clients for more), OR use https://app.element.io/ in your browser.


IRC
...

A lot of the development buzz will be spoken on IRC.

There is a **#qgis** channel on freenode.net.
You can also use a web interface: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#qgis
If you missed a discussion on IRC, not a problem! We log all discussion, so you
can easily catch up. Just go to https://qgis.org/irclogs.

There is also a **#qgis** channel on libera.chat.
You can use a web interface too: https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#qgis




User Groups
-----------

Local QGIS user groups are a great place to meet other users.

See :ref:`QGIS-usergroups` to read about it.


Website
-------

The website should be used to publish any material in relation to the information
and management of the user group. Examples include the user meetings, case study,
shared material, discussion boards, etc. Public material should be available without
login requirements (e.g. do not require interested people to be a member of a social
media network like Facebook or Google+). Usage of social media is recommended but
should not be the only channel of information. RSS feeds should be made available
at the Website of the QGIS user group.


Good luck with the organization of your local user group. Please inform the
international QGIS team by registering at the QGIS community list and reporting
about your progress. Please do not hesitate to ask questions regarding the
establishment and maintenance of your local user group.


Issue Tracker
-------------

If you want to file bugs or issues, see :ref:`QGIS-bugreporting`.


Commercial Support
------------------

You can also get support from companies near you, please visit this page: :ref:`QGIS-commercial_support`.


Forums
------

QGIS does not have a forum. Please either search in StackExchange (see below),
or via http://nabble.com in the history of our Mailinglists (see above).

For non-english, note that there also exist local forums that have a dedicated
section for QGIS you may need to search in.
