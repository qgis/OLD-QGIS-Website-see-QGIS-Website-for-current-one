12th QGIS Developer Meeting in Essen
====================================

The 12th QGIS Developer Meeting from 02 - 05 October 2014 was organised by `Geoinformatikbüro Dassau <http://www.gbd-consult.de>`_ and held for the second time at the `Linuxhotel <http://www.linuxhotel.de/>`_ in Essen, Germany. The Linuxhotel provided the venue, internet, accommodation and breakfast with very moderate conditions. It is a wonderful place and we are extremely grateful to them for organising and helping us to make the whole event went very smoothly. 

We also want to thank our gold sponsor `ASIA AIR SURVEY <http://www.asiaairsurvey.com/>`_, our silver sponsors `G.A.I.A. mbH <http://www.gaia-mbh.de>`_, and `State of Vorarlberg <http://www.vorarlberg.at/>`_, the German `FOSSGIS e.V. <http://www.fossgis.de/>`_ for sponsoring this event explicitly with 1500 Euros and the many people who have donated sums large and small to the QGIS project.

The money from donations was put to very good use funding the travel, accomodation and eating of most of the participants of the developer meeting. We would like to thank the virtual particpants present on IRC, the developer meeting was all the better for having your comments, testing and insights.

Summary of what happened at the hackfest
========================================

Firstly we should mention, that the greatest part of the time was spent in discussions. Meeting face to face gives us an opportunity to discuss the minutae of the project in a way that is imply not possible in our virtual discussions. The discussions also gave us a good chance to plan what should be the priorities after the major release of QGIS 2.6. More details on that further down. We had 35 people attending (most could attend for the full duration). They have been working on a wide variety of topics, e.g.:

Experiences and plans for the next hackfest
===========================================

The next hackfest is planned to be in May 2015 near Copenhagen. We would like to encourage all developers and non developers to join the meeting because it was extremely useful having them in Essen and there are many hackfest activities they can contribute with including documentation cleanups, translations, giving inputs to the user interface and user interaction ideas.
