Requirements for new contributors
=================================

We welcome new contributors to our community - we want you to use QGIS as a
platform for doing your work - and we believe that QGIS is a great platform for
that. In order to contribute code, patches, or documentation to the QGIS
project, all developers/team members must:

* Abide by the Social Contract.
* Be familiar with the development process and the reference material available
  in the Development Corner, and the CODING document in the root of the QGIS
  Sources.
* Ensure that all code committed to the repository is unencumbered and compatible
  with the QGIS license, GPL version 2
* Not use or include any code that will cause a trademark or patent infringement.
  If you are unsure, ask on the developer mailing list or contact a Project
  Steering Committee member.
* Join the qgis-developer mailing list and contribute to discussions
* These requirements apply to both developers desiring commit privileges and
  those that submit patches.
* Read and agree to the :ref:`codeofconduct`.
* Read and agree to the :ref:`coding_standards`.
* Read and agree to the :ref:`diversitystatement`.
* Agree to these requirements by sending an email to the qgis-developer mailing
  list stating agreement.
