Write Documentation

The update of the QGIS documentation is managed by the :ref:`Community Team Lead <community-resources>`.
Have a look at the :ref:`QGIS Governance <whoiswho>` to find out who is in charge
of guiding you.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS documentation team can be found
at https://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html. A list of documenters can be found at

.. _mailinglist-translation-docs:

Documentation Mailing list
--------------------------

If you plan to contribute to QGIS documentation, see :ref:`becoming-documenter`.
For other related questions, please contact the :ref:`Documentation Team Leader
<community-resources>` or subscribe with the `qgis-community-team
<http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team>`_ mailing list.

After subscribing to the mailing list you are able to send a mail directly to
qgis-community-team@lists.osgeo.org asking for help.

We strongly encourage anyone dealing with documentation and its translations to
join this list and promise that it is usually a very low traffic mailing list.

The other available mailing lists can be found at :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists`.

.. _becoming-documenter:

Becoming a documenter
---------------------

The QGIS project is always looking for people who are willing to invest some
more time updating QGIS documentation and translating it into a foreign language
- even perhaps to coordinate the update and translation effort.

We are trying to improve our project management process and spread the load
more evenly between people who each have a specific area of responsibility,
so any contribution you have to make will be greatly appreciated.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS Documentation Team can be found
at https://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html.
All the documentation sources are hosted in `QGIS-Documentation repository
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation>`_. If you want to update some features
in QGIS or document new ones, you need to:

- have a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_
- `fork the repository <https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/>`_
- do your changes
- and submit a pull request.

Instructions for contributing in documentation and managing a git repository
are available at `Documentation Guidelines
<http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/index.html>`_

.. tip:: **Direct access to source file**
  
  To easily find the file to update in the repository, use the
  ``Fix me`` link provided at the bottom of any page of the ``Testing``
  documentation. It directly opens the source file in your forked repo.
  Just make your changes, commit in a new branch and submit pull request to the
  main repository.
