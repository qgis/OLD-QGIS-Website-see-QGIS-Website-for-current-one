Update Documentation
====================

The update of the QGIS documentation is managed by the :ref:`Community Team Lead <gui-translation>`.
Have a look at the :ref:`QGIS Governance <gui-translation>` to find out who is in charge 
of guiding you.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS documentation team can be found 
at www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html. A list of documenters can be found at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/graphs/contributors.

.. _mailinglist-translation-docs:

Documentation Mailing list
...........................

If you plan to contribute to an existing document and for other related questions, 
please contact the Documentation Team Leader (see :ref:`Organigram <gui-translation>`) or 
subscribe with the `qgis-community-team <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team>`_
mailing list.

After subscribing to the mailing list you are able to send a mail directly to
qgis-community-team@lists.osgeo.org asking for help.

We strongly encourage anyone dealing with documentation and its translations to 
join this list and promise that it is usually a very low traffic mailing list.

The other available mailing lists can be found at :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists`.

Becoming a documenter
.....................

The QGIS project is always looking for people who are willing to invest some
more time updating QGIS documentation and translating it into a foreign language 
- even perhaps to coordinate the update and translation effort.

We are trying to improve our project management process and spread the load
more evenly between people who each have a specific area of responsibility,
so any contribution you have to make will be greatly appreciated.

If you would like to nominate yourself as a coordinator for a manual, a single 
manual chapter or a language please go ahead. If more than one person 
nominate themselves as coordinator for the same document, please contact each 
other and resolve how you will manage your efforts.

Please :ref:`contact <community-resources>` the Community Assistant or the Doc
translation team leader to see your name entered in the About Box of QGIS.

Helping with an existing translation
....................................

If you like to help translating an existing QGIS manual into a your language 
please assign to the :ref:`qgis-community-team mailing list <mailinglist-translation-docs>` 
and ask who is already working on that language to coordinate and collaborate.

HOWTO translate
...............

The QGIS documents are natively programmed in English. However, it is designed
to be translated into any language quite easily. At this moment several other 
languages are already available (though not all well maintained).

All available languages are listed in Transifex. It also shows
how much of it has been translated yet. The entire interface contains over
ten thousand pieces of text and a complete translation will take days if not
weeks to be finished. Besides that, the rapid development of the application
continuously causes new and edited texts to be translated. A huge effort and
your help will be appreciated!

Transifex
^^^^^^^^^

The web-based translating platform Transifex is used for all QGIS
translations; the desktop application itself (or GUI), the documentation and
the web site. So the first thing you need is an account to login and get
started.

Get an account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Go to www.transifex.com and create a new account
- Verify your account by the link in the email you will receive
- Login
- Choose your role as “Translator” and answer some other questions about yourself
- At your dashboard page click “Join an existing organisation” and search for “qgis”

Some QGIS organisations are listed now, among them are QGIS Desktop, Website and
Documentation.

- Choose in which part of the project you would like to participate
- You can be part of all projects and help everywhere too
- If the language of your choice is listed, click it and request to join the team.
- If your language is not listed yet, click “Request language” and choose your
  language. Keep in mind that translating the entire Desktop Application will take
  days of work, if not weeks!

Now you will need to wait for the maintainers to process your request. You will be
notified by email when your request has been accepted.

Note on new languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With requesting a new language please bear in mind that we try to make it as simple
as possible. Just ask for the language you want to translate (regardless in which
country you reside). Only if there are notable differences in the languages (for
example portuguese in Portugal in Brazil) we will create its own version.
