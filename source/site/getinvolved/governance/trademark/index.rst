Frequently Asked Questions 
-----------------------------

**Q:** *Do I need a permission?*

**A:** You need to apply for a permission if you are using the term “QGIS” as part of your own trademark or brand identifier for QGIS-based software goods or services. It doesn’t matter if your trademark is unregistered, or if you do not plan to make any money using the mark.

**Q:** *When do I have to show proper attribution?*

**A:** Whenever and however you use the term QGIS in print, on the internet, or in audio broadcasts, you should always give proper attribution to QGIS project. For more information see “Trademark Attribution.”

**Q:** *I am registering or have registered a trademark with my country's trademark authority. Do I still need a permission?*

**A:** Yes, assuming your trademark includes the element QGIS and it is being used in connection with software-related goods and services. Please note, the permission applies to QGIS trademark whether or not they are registered with a trademark authority. If you are using the term QGIS as a trademark (whether or not registered), you need to apply for a permission.

**Q:** *I am a commercial entity (for example, a company, partnership or sole proprietor, profit or non-profit) selling software-related goods or services and using the word "QGIS" in the entity’s name. Do I need to apply for a permission?*

**A:** Yes, because you are using QGIS as part of a trademark in connection with software-related goods or services. Software-related goods are computer programs and systems, or packages bundling software with tools, utilities, hardware, etc. Software-related services are services that deploy, document, facilitate the use of, or enhance computer programs and systems.

Even if you don’t use QGIS as part of the entity’s name, if the entity has a product or service (whether sold or given away for free) that uses "QGIS" in its name, you still need a permission for the use of the word QGIS in the name of the products or services.

**Q:** *If I get a permission for my trademark, will QGIS refuse to grant similar permissions to marks that are the same as, or confusingly similar to, my mark?*

**A:** No, QGIS will not attempt to ensure exclusivity or protect marks from infringement. QGIS considers the protection of trademarks against infringement to be the responsibility of the trademark owner. QGIS is not a dispute resolution authority, and does not become involved in disputes between trademark owners.

**Q:** *Trademark Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register a trademark for software-related goods or services that includes QGIS as an element. The application was rejected for confusing similarity to QGIS trademark. If I enter into a permission, will QGIS consent to my registration?*

**A:** No. The QGIS permission is not a consent for the registration of other trademarks. To protect the QGIS mark from dilution, we do not consent to the registration of trademarks found to be confusingly similar to the QGIS mark.

**Q:** *Domain Name Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register an internet domain name which includes the element QGIS. If we enter into a permission, will QGIS consent to our registration?*

**A:** QGIS and the QGIS permission have no control over the registration of domain names, which are distinct from trademarks (see related FAQs above). QGIS does not oppose the registration of domain names. You do not need a permission to use a domain name which includes QGIS, unless you use your QGIS domain name as a trademark.
