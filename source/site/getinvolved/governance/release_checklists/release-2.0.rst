Call for translators email
..........................

When translations call is made, an email based on the template below should
be sent out to encourage translators to get there work submitted.::


   Hi All (and especially translators)

   As of today please note that we are entering string freeze for the run up to
   the next release. If you are committing bug fixes please avoid changing any
   strings. Translation .ts files have been updated in SVN so please update your
   local svn checkouts. The period for translations will close MMMM-DD-YYYY (i.e.
   about one week from now) and then we will be branching for release. Any
   translations submitted to us after that time will only be included in the next
   release, so please submit what you have by then even if it is not complete.

   As always you can track the release plans via the checklist at:
   http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Release_Checklist_2.0.0

   If you have any questions about the translation process, please see the
   following page which includes instructions on how to generate a .ts file for a
   new locale.
   http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Gui_Translation

   Many thanks to all the translators out there for the great work you do!
   Regards,

   P.S.: The list of Translation Progress is here
   http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress#QGIS_Current_trunk_Version_Progress


Branching and Tagging Details
.............................

Branch the release using syntax below (update this with the actual commands you
used to branch).::

   git branch release-2_0
   git push origin release-2_0

Tag the release using a signed tag::

   git tag -s final-2_0_0 -m "Version 2.0.0"
   git push origin final-2.0.0


Bug Tracker System
..................

All bugs that are intended to have been fixed in this release should have been
marked as closed. All other bugs on the release branch should be marked for a
future release. To do this:

* create a new milestone and version e.g. we are releasing 2.0.0 now so create
  a new milestone in redmine for 2.0.0. Create the milestone here:

* Now you need to update each open bug on the branch and reset its milestone for
  the next release in the future. This can be done easily doing a batch update
  in redmine.


Create the source tarball
.........................

This is best achieved by running this little script::

  cd ~/QGIS
  git archive --format=tar --prefix=qgis-2.0.0/ final-2_0_0 | \
  bzip2 > /var/www/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2
  md5sum /var/www/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2 > \
  /var/www/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2.md5


Generate the changelog
......................

TODO: Add details here on how to generate the changelog.


Pro-forma call for packaging announcement
.........................................

mail::

 Hi All

 Dear QGIS devs & packagers

 --- Note to casual readers ---

 Please do not pre-announce this release - give the packagers and release team
 a chance to do their thing so that people hearing about the release have a fair
 chance of finding a package, reading all our press material etc.

 --- End note ---

 I have branched QGIS 2.0.0 for release. The branch can be checked out like
 this (as a tracking branch)

 git clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git
 git branch --track release-2_0 origin/release-2_0
 git checkout release-2_0

 Or (to check out the tag made immediately before branching)

 git fetch
 git checkout final-2.0.0


 Source tarballs can be obtained from here:

 http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2
 http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2.0.0.tar.bz2.md5

 Some notes:

 - Please do not commit anything to the release branch except packaging related
   tweaks.
 - If you make a package please be so kind as to update the download wiki page at
   http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download with the details of your package.
 - If you are able to make packages for unlisted platforms / distros please
   discuss your plans on this thread so that we can avoid duplication of effort.
 - I would like to make the release announcement next week, so it will be great
   to have as many packages as possible ready by then.
 - GIT master is open again for general commits - please seek guidance from
   Marco Hugentobler (PSC Code Manager) if you are planning any major code
   changes.
 - Please accompany any updates to core with unit tests!

 Many thanks to all the developers, testers, bug fixers, bug reporters, document
 writers, translators and users that help to make QGIS a reality!

 Lastly can I call on the release team (or any interested people) to help to put
 together visual changelog (link below), press announcements etc. ready for the
 release date? I will send you an email when the packages are ready and you can
 start broadcasting announcements.

 Visual Changelog Wiki Page: http://changelog.linfiniti.com/version/1/ (this is
 the site for drafting the release, the final release content will be on the
 official QGIS web site).

 Best regards


Windows Binary upload
.....................

Put the binary onto the server::

 cd /osgeo/download/qgis/win32/
 wget http://linfiniti.com/downloads/QGIS-2.0.0-0-No-GrassSetup.exe
 md5sum QGIS-2.0.0-0-No-GrassSetup.exe > QGIS-2.0.0-0-No-GrassSetup.exe.md5

Now do a virus check on it. First make a note of the url:

  http://download.osgeo.org/qgis/win32/QGIS-2.0.0-0-No-GrassSetup.exe

Now go to GarysHood online virus checker or similar to double check the binary
is virus free:
