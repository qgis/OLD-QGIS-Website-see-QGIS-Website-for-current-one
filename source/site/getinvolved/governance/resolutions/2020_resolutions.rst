Use of proprietary software
---------------------------
**Date of voting**: 2020-04-07

**Proponent**: Paolo Cavallini

**Introduction by the proponent**: Using proprietary software raises a number of issues, including security, privacy, long term data availablity, and more. Even more importantly, it is incoherent with our goal of creating good free software. 

**Rationale**: Free software should be the first choice for all the tools we use. We should choose proprietary alternatives only when it is proven that free software fails to provide a reasonable solution. The PSC should vote in case a proprietary solution is suggested.
