Proponent
===================================
Paolo Cavallini

Rationale
===================================
For each expenditure, after the work / item is done, but before payment, 
a report must be completed by the proponent, according to a simple template:
* Date of resolution
* Date of delivery
* Proponent
* Description of results
* Eventual links to full description, commit etc.
* Evaluation (success, partial success, failure).
Reports can be very short in case they are simple tasks, but we aim at completeness  
For recurring costs, only the initial report should be done  
All reports will be added to a single location.
