Diversity statement
===================

The QGIS Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.

While much of the work for our project is technical in nature, we value and 
encourage contributions from those with expertise in other areas, 
and welcome them into our community.
