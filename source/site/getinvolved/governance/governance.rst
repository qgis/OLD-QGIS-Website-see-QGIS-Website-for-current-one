members write code or documentation, while others are valuable as testers,
submitting patches and suggestions.

All contributions (adding code or documentation, fixing typo error, reporting
issues...) to the project are greatly appreciated.

These `individuals <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors>`_
are recognised as Contributors to the main code
`github repository <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS>`_.

Follow the lists of maintainers of the `documentation
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/graphs/contributors>`_ and the
