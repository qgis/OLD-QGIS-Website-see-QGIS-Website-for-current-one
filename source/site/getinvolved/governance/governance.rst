submitting patches and suggestions.

All contributions (adding code or documentation, fixing typo error, reporting
issues...) to the project are greatly appreciated.

These `individuals <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors>`_
are recognised as Contributors to the main code
`github repository <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS>`_.

Follow the lists of maintainers of the `documentation
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/graphs/contributors>`_ and the
